    "section": "1 Get away with your weak points",
    "text": "1 Get away with your weak points\nLet’s admit it, our chain of reasoning often has a weak point. The art of persuasion consists in getting around those weak points.\nA common strategy is first to explain the most significant negative point and then some smaller ones later. The less negative will stand in the shadow of the bigger. You can use this to your advantage by artificially inflating a negative point. Let’s call it the most obvious negative point. Be prepared to have some solution for this negative point. Then you can reap the reward of hiding your other negative points. However, the most critical part is to focus on the positive news, even if the positive news weighs little. What counts is that you talk more about the positive aspects of your solution than about the negative.\nIf you want to trigger a particular action, but the actual reason to do so is small:\n\nExaggerate the problem.\nContrast it to ridiculously high numbers if the argument is expressible in numbers.\nPresent your solution to the small and unimportant problem.\n\n“Millions of students drink milk, 1000 alone in our community school. Therefore I want to offer free milk.”\nA quick win: use the word “because” in illogical reasoning. The term indicates causality, and its use might make the listener accept a flaw."

    "text": "2 Give something to get something\nProviding free stuff is one of the pillars of the influencer economy. Once your audience is engaged, ask for something in return: a product purchase or a newsletter subscription. The person accepting your offer will feel obliged to return you a favor.\nThe identical process applies to oral presentations. Ask the audience to influence the story. You offer the audience an option. As this seems like a concession on your part, the audience feels obliged to believe you, and you get better buy-in. The trick is that you set up the choices and thus heavily influence the direction."

Many people only follow to be consistent with their past behavior. Be the dealer who brings the new stuff.\nBonus point: raise expectations. Ask what the reader wants to raise his attention. The receiver of your story thinks he was waiting for it as he committed to it early. It is less important whether he still would decide the same."

You might not become friends if you are together at a massive concert hall. On the contrary, there is a much higher chance that you will become friends in a small art venue.\nHow it works: Direct personal communication is most effective if you want something. Group ignorance kicks in if you request something from a group."

As Cialdini originally stated, there are too valuable to be abused to our disadvantage. But we can use them with a more positive intention that enables a win-win for our partner and us.\n\nAnd with this, I want to answer the two initial questions:\n How to apply these principles? How to defend against triggers?\nThe principles have many applications. Therefore, I want to look to the purpose of this blog: storytelling. I came up with the following questions:\n\nHow to use these principles to become a better storyteller?\nHow to form stories at the workplace from a social context?\nThe messenger’s image influences the message and vice-versa. It is therefore vital to be likable. How can we be liked more?\nHow to use the principles to transport business ideas better? How to use them to promote our ideas in technology and social engineering?"

    "text": "1. We give, and we take,\nCommunication is about giving and taking. We listen, and we expect to be listened to in return. Communication can also consist of following someone and being followed. This action relates to the principle of reciprocation. It relies on the fact that favor is to be met with favor. A frequent exploitation is to provide “false” favors. Sometimes your adversary will present this favor as a concession on his part. Then you feel obliged to meet it with a reciprocal concession.\nA genuinely gifted exploiter can not be spotted. He will always find the sweet spot of having his advantage. Worse, did you ever wonder why some people never give something in some groups? And why do they get away with it? The explanation is that we adapt to unfavorable give-take balances. This misbalance is especially treacherous as there is no defense over a longer time frame. If you conclude that you are always on the losing side one day, this principle could have been at work.\n\nDefend against hidden agendas\nIn my opinion, a robust value system is essential. Actively remind yourself what you want to achieve. Why do you do something? In what manner do you want to accomplish a task?"

    "text": "2. Little strokes fell great oaks\nWe all want our actions to chain to each other like a red thread. We want to be consistent with our past actions. Our actions are repeated commitments to ourselves. And if we’re going to have a strong story, we need consistency in our commitments.\nA strong story and red thread is the path to a fulfilled life.\nHowever, it makes us predictable and, in consequence, exploitable. Your aggressor will use an elaborated strategy to move you to a particular action. Somebody else can ask you to perform acts of ever-increasing size, which are more to his advantage than to yours. Long periods with repeated commitments are required.\nUsually, you start this chain of your own choice. So eventually, everything seems to have been your choice. At work, many group meetings work with this principle. In addition, “commitments are most effective when they are active, public, and effortful.” That is why you have such a hard time getting out of the situation.\n\nReflection is the key\nLuckily there are two good defenses. First, listen to your stomach. If it tells you there is something wrong early on, take a step back. Secondly, while listening deeply into your body, ask the following questions: “With all I know now, would I decide differently?”, “Would I make the same choice again?”. Your subconsciousness will answer with a feeling of uneasiness. You then can clearly explain to the other party why you will back out of the deal without getting angry."

Cooperation is an active association of ourselves to somebody. There is also guilt by association; the famous reputation is all about this. This effect is known as the halo effect. It works for things and attitudes, even the language. Suppose your opponent is saying “We” vs. “You” or “They.” in that case. In that case, they try to shift possession of the subject under discussion. The messenger is associated with the message.\n\nThe art of the deal\nMaybe that is not what Donald Trump meant but focus on the deal. Separate the message from the messenger. This approach will protect you against the lighter cases.\nThe more notable cases are easier to spot.\nIf you like somebody quicker than expected, reflect on whether he stands to gain. The stronger the effects, the more likely you will discover them with this defense. Think insurance broker or car dealership."

But it was going to be a failure of mental strength. My slides were thorough, my research meticulous—I was ready. Or so I thought. What unfolded next was a crash course in how not to deliver a presentation.\nAs I launched into the technical intricacies of metals, I saw it happening: glazed eyes, shifting seats, and disinterested glances. I soldiered on, believing that more context would do the job. When the session concluded, I received a blunt critique from my supervisor that hit me hard.\n“That was horrible. You lost them within the first five minutes.”\nAt that moment, I realized he was right. I had failed to connect. I hadn’t just buried the lead—I’d buried the audience under a mountain of unnecessary details. They didn’t need a crash course in material science; they needed the essentials, presented clearly and engagingly.\nIn an effort to improve, I sought inspiration from an unexpected place: journalism. Journalists excel at presenting complex information in a way that captures attention and keeps readers engaged. The most important thing for a journalist is: do not bury the lead."

    "text": "2 The Challenge Plot: David vs. Goliath\nThe Challenge Plot is about defying the odds. Think of underdog stories. Think of Rosa Parks taking a stand or the rebels in Star Wars fighting against the Empire. The key? The obstacles must appear enormous.\nChallenge plots are powerful because they inspire us to dig deep, persevere, and take bold action. They make us believe that we, too, can overcome adversity—whether it’s launching a startup or finishing a marathon. It helps to turn your message into a proverb.\nUse this plot when you want to inspire courage and grit. Examples are a high-stakes team kickoff or when motivating people to embrace ambitious goals. Use it, if you face a group of yes sayers."

It does not matter if it’s a heartwarming tale of neighbors helping each other after a disaster or a story about a team uniting for a cause. Connection Plots make us want to be better people.\nUse this plot when your goal is to foster teamwork, empathy, or unity—perfect for a company celebration or a social campaign."

Tired of feeling out of sync with the world, he embarked on a bizarre journey to simplify his mind. He tried alcohol, therapy, even surgery—all to silence his overthinking and live a more “normal” life.\nAntoine is the protagonist of How I Became Stupid by Martin Page. This satire-filled story isn’t just a critique of modern consumerism, but illustrates how over-complication can lead to paralysis. Antoine’s struggle reflects a deeper issue we all face: the Curse of Knowledge."

As we gain ability, it becomes harder to communicate our insights so others can understand. What’s obvious to us feels obscure to everyone else. Like Antoine, trapped in his hyper-analytical mind, experts and leaders often get stuck, unable to simplify their knowledge into actionable insights.\nMade to Stick’s SUCCES principles (Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories) rely on clarity, yet the Curse of Knowledge undermines them. It’s the classic “tapper-listener” problem: tappers, who know the song they’re tapping, can’t imagine what it’s like for listeners to not know it. This misalignment crops up everywhere—from CEOs giving instructions to engineers explaining technicalities. The disconnect isn’t mutual. The burden falls on the expert to simplify."

The expert can always teach his students. But what about an everyday situation where the expert has to explain to his superior?\nAs highlighted in The Ferrari’s Go to Disney World, this isn’t about hierarchy. Here, the customer is the novice.\nWhether the expert holds a higher or lower position, the challenge remains the same: convey ideas in a way that resonates. The customer might be the novice, but they hold decision-making power.\n\n4.1 Use Simplification to bridge the gap\nThere are two stages to solving a problem. The answer stage and the telling to others stage.\nMost organizations heavily invest in teaching people how to arrive at answers, but teach little how to communicate those answers. Factors that help develop expertise—nuance, depth, and precision—become liabilities in communication. Success isn’t just about finding answers; it’s about telling them in ways others can hear.\nAntoine’s first reflex is to just focus on stage 2. As the book shows, he becomes successful but not happy. Somewhere in the middle ground is the key. Antoine’s extreme journey shows a truth: intelligence and insight are insignificant without effective sharing. Simplicity, not complexity, is often the key to success."

We had several solid options. Each supplier provided a material according to our specification. However, the contract specifics were different. We devoted weeks to analyze sales forecasts and market trends to make the “perfect” choice.\nThen, an unexpected email arrived. A previously unavailable supplier offered the best material by far. We jumped at it, feeling an odd sense of relief, even though the price was quite high and the contract had a long duration. But was this the right decision? Not really, it was irrational.\nHere’s why: the material was great, but all the other materials were sufficient for our use case. Our exhaustive analysis led to a mental gridlock, and when a simple answer appeared, we grabbed it. This is a textbook case of decision paralysis leading to irrational actions."

Adopt Simple Policies\nPolicies streamline choices. For example, at McDonald’s, a personal policy like “always pick the promotion” adds variety and saves mental energy. At work, policies guide teams to prioritize action over analysis paralysis.\n\n\n3. Setting policies for others\nIf you’re crafting policies for others, make them memorable. A simple proverb can work wonders. Think: _ “Under the Golden Arches’ care, find a tasty deal and a moment to share.” _ The message stresses the deal, the promotion offer, and fosters adherence without overthinking."

    "text": "1 The Problem with Repetition\nIf you have visited a communication seminar, you may have come across the old communication formula: “tell them what you’re going to tell, tell them, and then tell them what you told”. This formulaic approach to communication relies on repetition, which often flattens engagement.\nBeginners will find this perfectly suitable, as it clarifies points. However, it lacks emotional impact and quickly becomes predictable.\nToday’s audiences, that are subjected to constant information overload, need more than just facts: they want stories, surprises, and insights that cut through the noise.\nFlight safety announcements illustrate this principle perfectly. Traditional ones, filled with the same old safety reminders, cause passengers to tune out. But when airlines add humor, dramatize scenarios, or weave in storytelling, they break the pattern and seize attention."

Conspiracy theories and gossip thrive because they create knowledge gaps that we feel compelled to fill.\nThe challenge for every communicator with an important message: strategic “planned unexpectedness” should strengthen a core message rather than just generate cheap thrills."

To make ideas stick, you must first break people’s assumptions and then help them rebuild their mental models.\nBegin by clarifying the one thing you want them to remember, then expose an unexpected truth that challenges their beliefs. Present it in a way that forces them to pause and reconsider. Finally, guide them toward a realization that feels obvious in hindsight.\nPsychologists call this obvious hindsight “postdictability.” In contrast, common sense, the enemy of sticky messages, lulls people into complacency. By deliberately violating it, you engage the audience’s deeper reasoning processes (their “System 2”) and lead them to an “I could have guessed that” moment once the surprise is explained. Here again, the challenge is to do it without descending into gimmicks. Suprise alone is not enough"

    "text": "4 The Gap Theory of Curiosity\nOnce you have your audience’s attention, the challenge becomes to keep it. You need to kindle their curiosity. Whenever we perceive a gap between what we know and what we want to know, we experience a mental itch we’re driven to scratch.\nTo harness this, open with a puzzle or a provocative claim: “There’s an invisible chemical in your home—and it might kill you right now.”\nYou can suggest that someone else holds crucial information, hint at unresolved mysteries, or you can challenge the audience to predict an outcome.\nThis approach works in everything from sports events to fundraising campaigns, even daily politics.\nThere are two extreme cases: people who think they know everything and those who know nothing. For the first, make them publically commit to a prediction. This makes them more curious as they have had an active say. The second group is best told some points that act as a reference system on their blank canvas.\nInstead of spoon-feeding the facts in chronological order, start with a haunting question or puzzling hypothesis. Actively hide information to reveal it later. Use mystery in your presentation. Only after you’ve sparked curiosity do you reveal the facts. Ensure your audience stays hooked until the gap is closed and your message sticks."

    "text": "1 The 5xWhy: A Path to Simplicity or a Trail to Blame?\nMany praise the simplicity of the 5xWhy method, rooted in the principles of lean manufacturing. It involves asking “Why?”. People repeat the question until they find the problem’s root cause.\nHowever, this apparent simplicity can be deceptive. Often the root cause is human error or a decision-making error, done by humans. This singular focus, while useful in pinpointing individual causes, can inadvertently cultivate a culture of blame and finger-pointing.\nThe issue with this approach is multifold. First, it oversimplifies complex problems. In the intricate web of corporate operations, issues are seldom the result of a single cause. Second, the spotlight on individuals rather than processes can lead to a defensive atmosphere. Employees may feel targeted and stressed, fearing that each session of 5xWhy could turn into a fault-finding mission.\nAs a result, nobody will cooperate."

    "text": "2 The Fishbone Diagram: Casting a Wider Net\nEnter the Fishbone Diagram, also known as the Ishikawa Diagram. This method takes a distinctly different approach. It’s a tool that encourages teams to explore multiple potential causes of problems, categorized into various ‘bones’ like Methods, Machines, People, Materials, Measurements, and Environment.\nThe beauty of the Fishbone Diagram lies in its collaborative and holistic nature. By involving team members across different functions and perspectives, it fosters a sense of collective problem-solving. The focus shifts from individual blame to system-wide inefficiencies and process improvements.\nThis approach promotes a positive atmosphere where team members feel encouraged to contribute. The visual nature of the diagram aids in this. The teams can see at a glance how various factors interplay."

Otherwise, Fishbone."

    "text": "Failure is not an option\nThe project was more than just another task on my list; it was a make-or-break opportunity for our construction company. We had been tasked with completing a state-of-the-art residential complex within a tight deadline, which would significantly impact our reputation in the industry. The project was a complex blend of innovative architectural design, sustainable materials, and cutting-edge technology. The pressure was immense, and the tight deadline only amplified the stakes. Failure was not an option.\nAs the project progressed, I noticed my team was struggling to stay motivated. We were so focused on the end goal that it became overwhelming. Coordinating subcontractors, navigating supply chain disruptions, and ensuring compliance with stringent building codes and regulations took a toll on my team’s morale. The sheer magnitude of the project was causing anxiety, and we were losing sight of the smaller steps that would lead us to success. I knew I had to act quickly and find a solution to turn things around.\nIn my search for an effective approach, I stumbled upon the idea of breaking down our seemingly insurmountable goal into smaller, more manageable tasks. Desperate to see a change, I implemented this strategy, but the initial results were disappointing. My team remained overwhelmed, and progress was still slow. In my desperation to get things back on track, I found myself micromanaging the team, scrutinizing their every move, and unintentionally creating a toxic work environment.\nRealizing that my micromanagement was only making matters worse, I knew I needed to find a more structured and efficient way to organize and prioritize tasks without suffocating my team. That’s when I discovered a systematic approach to managing activities, which promised to streamline our workflow and keep us focused on the most critical tasks while fostering a healthy team dynamic.\nI decided to give it a shot, and the transformation in my team was nothing short of miraculous. By adopting this method, we were able to concentrate on one task at a time, celebrating each small win along the way. The sense of accomplishment and progress brought the team closer together, and we began to work more efficiently. As we tackled each activity, from obtaining permits and coordinating with subcontractors to managing onsite safety and quality control, the once-distant goal suddenly felt within reach.\nThe project’s success not only saved our company but also solidified our reputation as a construction firm that could rise to any challenge. The experience taught me the power of a structured approach to managing activities, the importance of adaptability in the face of adversity, and the value of trusting and empowering my team. It was a turning point in my career, and it’s a lesson I’ll never forget."

    "text": "2 Effect of the knowledge worker\nAs Drucker already pointed out: The number of knowledge workers is steadily increasing. Today’s work organization work is a recent invention of a mere 200 years. Before the industrial revolution, professionals organized themselves in guilds and were often still doing a lot of manual labor. The most experienced worker was leading the others and showed the ropes.\nOnly when unskilled labor started to increase did another work organization become necessary. The foreman was born. The job consisted mainly in telling others what to do. As the jobs became more specialized, knowledge work steadily increased. It was enough for a steel worker in the 19th century to have big muscles. Today he needs to know metallurgies. What has remained constant is the way we organize people.\nThis managing of people has produced ever-larger hierarchies. Commonly, the person at the top is utterly unfamiliar with the work at the bottom. Over the last 100 years, our society has accepted this paradigm. Chief executives are excused from having a profound IT background in the IT industry by saying their work requires another skill set.\nBut if we started with a clean slate, how should we organize the work if only skilled people would be working in the trade?\nDirect supervision only allows organizations of limited size, like in the middle ages.\nThe solution is clear, and everybody is already talking about leadership. Authentic leadership understands the problems of the simple craftsman as it is not too far away from his problems. At the same time is far enough above his daily trials and has a broader scope and vision."

    "text": "1 You have not met any other leader.\nWhy do you think you have not met any other leader? The law of magnetism provides a possible explanation: “Who you are is who you attract.” In other words, try to lead people, and other leaders will be attracted to you by social dynamics.\nMaybe other people in your organization face the same issues. They struggle to build up influence. Hence positional leadership is dominant. Positional leadership is not real leadership as it relies on extrinsic motivation: we all need to earn money from somewhere.\nAnother option is that you did not perceive other leaders as leaders.\n“The more leadership ability a person has, the more quickly he recognizes leadership – or its lack – in others.” Not spotting any other leaders maybe means you are an incompetent leader yourself.\nBut I am doing so much to be successful, says the little voice in your head.\nIf you are already active, think that “activity is not necessarily accomplishment.” Reflect on Requirement, Return, and Reward. Map your activities to the three Rs.\n\nWhat is required of me?\nWhat gives the greatest return?\nWhat brings the greatest reward?\n\n\n1.1 How to meet other leaders\nFirst and foremost: be yourself. “Leaders go their way.” Only by doing so can they maintain direction when a group comes together.\nBeing a better leader for yourself will attract other like-minded people.\nThe essential difference is also a leader is initializing the connection.\nEven though you do not perceive somebody as a leader, you can still connect to him. Think about if you think they have value for the organization and your cause.\nIn a hierarchical organization, that also includes leading upwards. What can you do for the person above you to help them grow as leaders and in their careers? This approach is tricky as it requires balancing their needs and your own goals. Once you have identified their goals, look for your side’s best effort/reward action. Be aware that their goals are not necessarily as transparent as they seem."

The law of the inner circle means that a leader will surround himself with people that he thinks are capable of helping him with his vision. A strong leader will surround himself with other leaders.\nBut looking a little closer, your “leaders” may not be “secure leaders” who “give others power.” Perhaps the leaders you have met try to foster their position first by building a good team. Growing a team of teams might not be in their interest. These leaders may not follow a strategy of “explosive growth.” Instead, they aim at linear growth by keeping things under control.\n\n2.1 How to improve\nStart with yourself. Foster your character strength and then build up relationships. Character is defined by being consistent with your principles. Easier said then done. Get up and do the work.\nThese three steps can help you:\n\nRelationships are fundamentally relying on respect. Without respect, you can not build trust. Without trust, there is no relationship. Pay respect to others, especially those with even less power than you. Try to give away power yourself. Everybody has some little influence.\nFollow your development plan; for example, one book a month, one youtube talk a week, and one conference a year.\nHelp others follow their development plan. Do they have one? Why not? Be their mentor in the first steps or by navigating complex issues."

    "text": "Practical Insights from Zelda’s Success\nSo, what can we learn from Zelda’s success in terms of interactive storytelling? The key takeaway is the crucial need to listen and adapt to our audience. Stories must not progress faster than the audience can comprehend, and the storyteller must recognize when the audience is evolving during the narrative.\nFailure to understand and cater to the audience’s needs can lead to disengagement and a lack of impact. Let’s consider an example: if a speaker aims to promote the principles of constellation networks, they must first understand that their listeners might be more accustomed to a heliocentric, pyramid-based mindset. To effectively convey their message, the speaker must start by addressing the factors that hold the pyramid together and gradually introduce the concept of a flexible, rotating pyramid.\nAs creators of interactive stories, it’s our responsibility to:\n\nUnderstand our audience: Know their interests, background, and expectations.\nEngage from the start: Capture their attention early and maintain it with a steady stream of compelling details.\nEncourage active participation: The audience can explore and interact with the story, fostering a deeper connection.\nAdapt to the audience’s transformation: Modify the narrative to cater to the audience’s evolving needs and understanding.\n\nFollowing these principles, we can create captivating interactive stories that keep our audience engaged and invested in the narrative. The enchanting world of Zelda has taught us the importance of audience engagement in interactive storytelling – now it’s time for us to put these lessons into practice. Embrace the challenge, and create unforgettable experiences that resonate with our audience!"

Great. Frequently, personal blogs feature a collection of diverse topics. Countless are the numbers of blogs that were started, but later abandoned. Hopefully this blog will survive at least several years.\nIn my research on blog creation I found one important aspect touching the heart of the blog: its purpose.\nHosting and website creation are important, the content is far more important.\nAs already mentioned, many personal blogs write about various topics. However, over time it is easier to create new content and attract followers, if you have a purpose. Having a purpose does not necessarily mean that you always write about about the same topic. The different topics can be slightly related. And of course you can explore side-topics. Think about computer roll playing games. There is the main story-line and there are many big and small side quests.\nOnly you can discover your blog’s purpose. Good points to start the exploration of the purpose: What was your motivation when you decided that you want to create a blog? Do you intended to help someone with your blog?\nMy main idea for the blog was storytelling. I want to write about the topic of effective communication and getting the point across. How to not get lost in the myriad of options that we have today.\nThe next blog post will shed some more light on this.\nIf you are not able to identify your blog’s purpose, but still feel the urge to write a blog, go for it.\nA frequent tip is to just start and see what works.\n\n\n\nOnce you answered the question of the blog’s purpose, it is time to name your blog.\nYou need a name for several reasons. My non exclusive list:\n\nYour own identification with your blog.\nYou need to host the blog somewhere.\nIf you want people to read the blog, the name should be intelligible and easy to remember. If you do not want anybody to find your blog go for “x2s5qm24”.\n\nThere are many good resources to help you.\nSee for example: https://www.ryrob.com/how-name-blog/ or https://bloggingwizard.com/choose-a-blog-name/.\nThere are different flavors of blog naming:\n\n\nMany people choose their own name or add a profession, e.g. mrsmithwriter.\nUse an abbreviation of your name: dolind.\nIf you are an engineer or software developer, a good option to include .tech in the domain name., your-name.tech.\nThis is also helpful for your CV. Consider the two email addresses and which one looks more professional.\ninfo@mrsmithwriter.tech\nj.smith75@bestmailproviderever.com\nFor the first address, the conveyed message hopefully is: I know my way around in the internet and in technology.\n\n\n\nThe other route followed by many blog creators. Name the blog after your business idea. However, considering specific ideas the idea is best represented by its very own domain. Chances are high that you pick something you will later abandon for something else.\n\n\n\nClosely related but slightly different: name the blog with regard to its purpose.\nThis should help the readers of the blog to associate the blog with a specific solution or a reliable source of information.\nMy blog’s purpose is storytelling. As I currently do not want to limit the blog the much, the scope will still be quite large.\nSome names already existed or were even registered as a trademark. Other names were quite artsy and on second thought too complicated, gallimaufry, Story Entangled or Story Potpouri.\nReflecting on different blog names I was sipping my wiener melange when it dawned on me:\nI had found my blog name.\n\n\n\nphoto by unsplash\n\n\nWith the choices we make in our lives, we create our very own mixtures from the possibilities and flavors the society offers. These mixtures, these melanges, which we create are the stories of our lives.\nWelcome to Story Melange and enjoy your coffee."

Do you intended to help someone with your blog?\nMy main idea for the blog was storytelling. I want to write about the topic of effective communication and getting the point across. How to not get lost in the myriad of options that we have today.\nThe next blog post will shed some more light on this.\nIf you are not able to identify your blog’s purpose, but still feel the urge to write a blog, go for it.\nA frequent tip is to just start and see what works.\n\n\n\nOnce you answered the question of the blog’s purpose, it is time to name your blog.\nYou need a name for several reasons. My non exclusive list:\n\nYour own identification with your blog.\nYou need to host the blog somewhere.\nIf you want people to read the blog, the name should be intelligible and easy to remember. If you do not want anybody to find your blog go for “x2s5qm24”.\n\nThere are many good resources to help you.\nSee for example: https://www.ryrob.com/how-name-blog/ or https://bloggingwizard.com/choose-a-blog-name/.\nThere are different flavors of blog naming:\n\n\nMany people choose their own name or add a profession, e.g. mrsmithwriter.\nUse an abbreviation of your name: dolind.\nIf you are an engineer or software developer, a good option to include .tech in the domain name., your-name.tech.\nThis is also helpful for your CV. Consider the two email addresses and which one looks more professional.\ninfo@mrsmithwriter.tech\nj.smith75@bestmailproviderever.com\nFor the first address, the conveyed message hopefully is: I know my way around in the internet and in technology.\n\n\n\nThe other route followed by many blog creators. Name the blog after your business idea. However, considering specific ideas the idea is best represented by its very own domain. Chances are high that you pick something you will later abandon for something else.\n\n\n\nClosely related but slightly different: name the blog with regard to its purpose.\nThis should help the readers of the blog to associate the blog with a specific solution or a reliable source of information.\nMy blog’s purpose is storytelling. As I currently do not want to limit the blog the much, the scope will still be quite large.\nSome names already existed or were even registered as a trademark. Other names were quite artsy and on second thought too complicated, gallimaufry, Story Entangled or Story Potpouri.\nReflecting on different blog names I was sipping my wiener melange when it dawned on me:\nI had found my blog name.\n\n\n\nphoto by unsplash\n\n\nWith the choices we make in our lives, we create our very own mixtures from the possibilities and flavors the society offers. These mixtures, these melanges, which we create are the stories of our lives.\nWelcome to Story Melange and enjoy your coffee."

    "text": "2 Precision and recall\nThese numbers are expressed in absolute terms. Sometimes it is more helpfull to focus on relative numbers. If we are interested in how many of the positive values should have been positive, we are interested in the precision. Precision is the ratio of true positives to the total number of instances that are classified as positive by the model. It is given by:\nPrecision = TP / (TP + FP)\nIf we are interested in model ability to identify all positive instances, we look for recall. Recall is the ratio of true positives to the total number of actual positive instances in the data.\nRecall = TP / (TP + FN)\nThese metrics are important because in many cases, precision and recall have an inverse relationship. That is, improving one metric may come at the cost of the other. For example, a model that is overly conservative in making positive predictions may have high precision but low recall, as it is less likely to make false positive errors but may also miss many true positive instances. On the other hand, a model that is more aggressive in making positive predictions may have high recall but low precision, as it may capture more true positives but also generate more false positives.\nBy considering the confusion matrix with FN/TN/FP/TP, precision and recall can be calculated to evaluate the performance of a classification model. The confusion matrix shows the number of true and false predictions for each class, and it can be used to calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall."

    "section": "2 FEM",
    "text": "2 FEM\n\n2.1 Background\nThe Finite Element Method (FEM) began in the 1940s for aerospace structural analysis and grew with computing advances in the 1950s–60s. It works by breaking down complex structures into smaller, manageable elements, solving equations over these elements, and assembling the results. Today, FEM is vital in simulating real-world physics across engineering and science.\n\n\n2.2 FEM and the step size in line search\nIn mechanical application of the finite element method, we are interest to solve the equation: \\[\\mathbf{K} \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{f}_{\\text{ext}}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{K}\\) is the global stiffness matrix.\n\\(\\mathbf{u}\\) are the nodal displacements (unknowns).\n\\(\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{ext}}\\) are the nodal forces.\n\nThe residual is \\(\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{ext}}-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{u}\\).\nA gradient-descent-based update rule takes the form:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{u}_t - \\alpha (\\mathbf{K} \\mathbf{u}_t-\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{ext}})\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is the step size or damping factor, which controls update magnitude.\nIn a linear system we can use a potential to describe this\n\\[\\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}} \\Pi=\\mathbf{K} \\mathbf{u}_t-\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{ext}}\\]\nso we get\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{u}_t - \\alpha \\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}} \\Pi\n\\]\nAn illustration is in the following picture.\n\n\n\nThe step size is the length of each arrow.\n\n\nIf computational resources allow and the matrix \\(\\mathbf{K}\\) is not too large, a direct solution can be obtained using:\n\\[\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{K}^{-1} \\mathbf{f}_{\\text{ext}}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNotation\n\n\n\nIn this document I use \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) for a vector and \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) for a matrix.\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Influence of Nonlinearity\nFor linear mechanics, the solution is straightforward. The issue arises only when we introduce non-linearity.\nNonlinearities arise from\n\nlarge displacement paths,\nlarge rotations\nenergy dissipating process (plasticity)\ndamping\n\nIn the presence of large displacements, these non-linearities lead to ill-conditioning of the matrix \\(K\\). A tiny step size would be necessary unless matrix K is adapted. Many solution algorithms exist.\n\\[\\mathbf{u}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{u}_t + \\alpha_t \\mathbf{K}^{-1} \\mathbf{r}_t\\]\nWe find the optimal \\(\\alpha_t\\) by minimizing the strain energy functional.\n\\[\\alpha_t = \\arg\\min_{\\alpha} J(\\mathbf{u}_t  - \\alpha \\mathbf{K}^{-1} \\mathbf{r}_t)\\]\nOne major issue is that the stiffness matrix is variable, there is only a tangent stiffness matrix, \\(\\mathbf{K}_t\\), which requires frequent recomputation. This tangent matrix is also called in more general terms the Hessian, which describes the second-order curvature. We will not get into the details here, but we will get back to it below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIll-conditioning\n\n\n\nThe following picture shows geometry as one of the ill-conditioning causes. One element is a lot bigger than the other.\n.\nHere’s an example of an ill-conditioned matrix:\n\\[\\mathbf{K} = \\begin{bmatrix} 10 & 10 \\\\ 10 & 10.0001 \\end{bmatrix}\\]\nThis matrix has a high condition number, making it sensitive to small changes in input, which can lead to large errors in numerical computations."

    "text": "3 Machine learning\n\n3.1 Linear models\nMachine learning began with linear models like the equation:\n\\[\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}+\\mathbf{b}\\].\nIt draws from statistics and early perceptron models of the 1950s.\nHere\n\n\\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is the vector of output labels (dependent variable)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is the feature matrix, the input data, or independent variable\n\\(\\mathbf{w}\\) are the weights(model parameters)\n\\(\\mathbf{b}\\) are biases, which we can include in w\n\nYou can write this as: \\[\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}=\\mathbf{y}\\]\nA direct solution equivalent to the FEM equation\n\\[\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{K}^{-1} \\mathbf{r}\\]\nis the equivalent least squares solution is:\n\\[\\mathbf{w} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}\\]\nwhere (\\(\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\) is like the inverse of the stiffness matrix, \\(\\mathbf{K}^{-1}\\) .\n\n\n3.2 Influence of size and non-linearity\nHowever, ML problems usually have many more parameters than than FEM problems. This brings a few drawbacks for the direct solution.\n\nmatrix inversion is costly and works at \\(O(n^3)\\) in time.\nand requires \\(O(n^2)\\) in space.\ncorrelated features, can lead to near-singular matrices making inversion impossible.\n\nIn addition, it would only work for linear problems, whereas many issues are non-linear, expressed as:\n\\[\\mathbf{y} = f(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{w})\\]\nwhere - \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is the output vector - \\(f(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{w})\\) is a general function\nDevelopment has focused on iterative methods. Here, the same solvers exist as for FEM: gradient descent, conjugate gradient, or L-BFGS. Mini-batches solve the space requirement issue by analyzing only a small subset. This is then called stochastic gradient descent.\n\n\n3.3 Gradient descent\nInstead of direct inversion, ML often uses gradient descent``, similar toiterative solvers in FEM` (like conjugate gradient method):\n\\[\\mathbf{w}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{w}_t - \\alpha \\nabla J(\\mathbf{w}_t)\\],\nwhere \\(J(\\mathbf{w})\\) is the loss function (analogous to potential energy in FEM). Now \\(\\alpha\\) is the learning rate, but you can see the equation is identical to the FEM equation.\nIn our analogy, the stiffness matrix \\(\\mathbf{K}\\) is replaced by the loss function. A common choice for regression problems is the Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n\\[J(\\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\mathbf{w})^2\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(N\\) is the number of samples.\n\\(y_i\\) is the true label.\n\\(\\mathbf{X}_i\\) is the feature vector (row) for sample i in the matrix.\n\nThe gradient of the loss function is:\n\\[\\nabla J(\\mathbf{w}) = -\\frac{2}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\mathbf{w}) \\mathbf{X}_i\\]\nFor more complex problems, first order gradient descent is not enough, we need second order approaches. We examine the curvature and then it is called the Hessian. But again, as for FEM, this is too complex for this article.\n\n\n3.4 Batch size\nAs already mentioned, ML problems use a lot of parameters and a lot of data. The size of the data, which is filled in the matrix is called the batch. Using a batch size smaller than the full data is called a mini-batch. We then use a stochastic gradient descent. It is called stochastic as we use a sample of the full data.\nIn theory, the mini-batch can go down to 1. In practice this is rare.\n\\[\\mathbf{w}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{w}_t - \\alpha \\frac{1}{|B|} \\sum_{i \\in B} \\nabla J_i(\\mathbf{w}_t)\\]\nwhere\n\n\\(|B|\\) is the batch size\n\\(\\nabla J_i\\) is the evaluation of the loss function for the batch sample\n\nThis approach of divide and conquer is a classic in computer science. In the FEM similar approaches have been developed for large-scale problems, see for example the PGD and other reduced order modeling techniques.\n\n\n3.5 The learning rate, limits progress\nWe have previously examined analogies between many optimization equations. One concept that remains to be discussed is the damping factor—a critical component in both numerical methods and machine learning.\nReturning to the idea of line search, we can observe that a similar approach to what is used in FEM can also be applied in machine learning. In this context, the learning rate becomes variable, adapting at each iteration to minimize the objective function along the descent direction:\n\\[\\alpha_t = \\arg\\min_{\\alpha} J(\\mathbf{w}_t - \\alpha \\nabla J(\\mathbf{w}_t))\\]\nFor small to medium ml problems, this is an excellent solution. This approach ensures a stable convergence of the training process. The issue is that each extra forward/backward pass doubles cost. If your package offers “line search”, this is often backtracking or heuristic scaling.\nFor deep learning tasks, inventive folks have come up with explicit prescriptive updates, like the ADAM optimizer. It handles the update rate for each parameter solely based on the gradients.\n\\[m_t = \\beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \\beta_1) \\nabla J(\\mathbf{w}_t)\\]\n\\[v_t = \\beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \\beta_2) (\\nabla J(\\mathbf{w}_t))^2\\]\n\\[\\mathbf{w}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{w}_t - \\frac{\\alpha m_t}{\\sqrt{v_t} + \\epsilon}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(m_t\\) is the moving average of gradients (momentum-like behavior).\n\\(v_t\\) tracks the moving average of squared gradients (scales learning rates).\n\\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\) control exponential decay rates.\n\nFor the FEM guys reading this: this approach resembles explicit dynamics mass scaling of the time step. There, we calculate the permissible step size for each element and then add any artificial mass to each element. This artificial mass brings the global step size to a desired target.\nNumerically, the approaches differ. Some ensure convergence directly or iteratively; others use update rules and heuristics.\nIterative solvers, such as BFGS and L-BFGS, still have their place in more specialized fields that have higher demands on accuracy or suffer from greater instability.\nThe major advantage is that L-BFGS can converge faster than SGD.\nPeople use it on classic ML problems, with datasets that fit in memory, that is no mini-batch and especially reinforcement learning to handle the instabilities better.\nAnother field where a BFGS could be better is fine tuning, small networks, hyper parameter optimization, and word embeddings.\nThe field of machine learning is much less mature than FEM, in terms of terminology and also in the development of new numerical methods."

    "text": "What did i learn from modern c++?\nI read Effective Modern C++ by Scott Meyers to learn the ins and outs of c++11 and 14.\n\nTemplate and auto deduction\nTemplate type deduction can sometimes ignore reference types, especially when dealing with complex, chained types. This behavior can lead to unexpected results.\nWith C++11, the most common instance of this is the auto keyword, which operates similarly to template type deduction. You might have encountered cases where you expected a specific type, but the compiler deduced a different type, causing compatibility issues later. One key difference is the use of braces {}, which indicate a std::initializer_list.\nThe auto keyword also introduces an interesting debate between conservative and progressive tool usage. Advocates of vi-style text editors often prefer explicit types, as they can infer the type directly from the source code. With auto, this is no longer possible.\nHowever, in modern IDEs, explicit type inference is unnecessary because type deduction is readily available via features like hover-over tooltips. This implicit deduction shifts focus to the variable’s purpose rather than its type—provided the variables are well-named.\n\n\nBrace yourself\nHaving picked up my c++ skills after 2011, I used braced or universal initialization as much as I can. It has many advantages and the confusion that arises from the dual use of braces and parantheses is limited to a few cases: std::vector initialization and templates.\n\n\nTypedefs are for Nulls\nLegacy C++ code, especially from older colleagues, often includes NULL and typedefs.\n\nReplace NULL with nullptr. NULL is essentially a compiler directive and less safe compared to nullptr.\nStrive for self-documenting code, which is easier to read and maintain. Avoid standard types when possible and define your own types for clarity.\n\nThe using keyword offers a cleaner, more intuitive syntax compared to typedef: It reads like an assignment and conceptually replaces typedef, functioning to the class keyword.\nFor constants, prefer constexpr over #define to ensure type safety and better integration with modern C++ features.\n\n\nKeep it in order\nNamespace pollution is a common issue in unstructured code. This applies to classic 2000-line functions, but also to modern tools which can lack proper scoping mechanisms, for example early versions of CMake.\nIn C++, scoped enums (enum class) help address this problem by making enums behave more like classes. With enum class, you must explicitly specify the scope to access a value, like telling the compiler which “drawer” to look in for the red_card. For example:\nenum class Color { Red, Green, Blue };\nColor myColor = Color::Red;\nThis prevents naming conflicts and keeps the codebase cleaner.\n\n\nconst correctness\nIf you worked with classes you surely have come accross const correctness. New to me was the fact that the iterators can be const in C++14.\n\n\nBeing smart\nBy now, everyone is familiar with smart pointers and their advantages. However, I often encounter code that exclusively uses shared_ptr. While this doesn’t usually impact performance, it significantly reduces readability.\nMy take aways: Use a standard type. If you get problems think about who is using the variable. If there is only owner and user of the variable use a unique pointer and move it. If you are not sure use a shared pointer. Always use make_shared/unique. All other rules cover the 1 % of all use cases.\n\n\nWe are many\nConcurrent programming is a big topic. My key take away is the prefered usage of std::async instead of threads. Only keep the default launch policy in mind. If you have simultanous access to a member variable use std::atomic.\n\n\nAnd then it got too much\nMuch about the second half of the book is about the difference between lvalue and rvalue and when to move or forward something. I am rarely exposed with the more exotic cases in my work."

This results in a strong coupling of software.\nOf course, defining those contracts hands over the control to the fulfiller of the contract. If an internal software team is responible, this means less central planning and more local competition to fulfill contracts.

This is more than a technical gap: it inflates costs, undermines strategic goals, and leaves CFOs and project teams equally frustrated.\nI came into contact with this at one of my projects. The project had an innovative product, a motivated and skilled team, and innovative technology. Yet, teams spent much of their time battling messy code and poorly integrated systems, turning an exciting initiative into a never-ending fix-it job. These technical failures often stemmed from a lack of—or an immature—software architecture.\nPoor architecture doesn’t stay confined to development; it soon becomes a C-level concern. CFOs see skyrocketing budgets, extended timelines, and uncertain ROI. Projects billed as game-changers collapse under the weight of their own technical debt, revealing just how critical a robust architecture really is.\nTo better understand why rapid development can backfire, consider a familiar fable that illustrates how slow and steady can prevail over quick but careless efforts."

But you can easily create your own.\nAs I run most of my code locally, I have some code to get it from Kaggle\n\ncompetition_name= None\ndataset_name = 'cheese'\n\nimport os\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\niskaggle = os.environ.get('KAGGLE_KERNEL_RUN_TYPE', '')\nif competition_name:\n    if iskaggle: \n        comp_path = Path('../input/'+ competition_name)\n    else:\n        comp_path = Path(competition_name)\n        if not path.exists():\n            import zipfile,kaggle\n            kaggle.api.competition_download_cli(str(comp_path))\n            zipfile.ZipFile(f'{comp_path}.zip').extractall(comp_path)\n\n\nif dataset_name:\n    if iskaggle:\n        path = Path(f'../input/{dataset_name}')\n    else:\n        path = Path(dataset_name)\n        if not path.exists():\n            import zipfile, kaggle\n            kaggle.api.dataset_download_cli(dataset_name, path='.')\n            zipfile.ZipFile(f'{dataset_name}.zip').extractall(path)        \n\nNow we have downloaded the data, we can start using it."

The last two are two standard mountain cheeses, one from France and the other from Switzerland. The only differ by their texture. Comte of the same age are a little creamier and have fewer crevices.

However, it is also not imbalanced, as the imbalance is 2:1 and not 1:10, an order of magnitude. We stick with accuracy.\n\n\n\n5.2 Data Augmentation\nWe do not have many images in the data. Therefore, we will use data augmentation and move from squishing to RandomResizedCrop.\n\ncheese_augmented = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), \n    get_items=get_image_files, \n    splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),\n    get_y=parent_label,\n    item_tfms=RandomResizedCrop(192, min_scale=0.3),\n    batch_tfms=aug_transforms(mult=2))\n\ndls = cheese_augmented.dataloaders(\"working/which_cheese_cleaned\")\n\n\nNote: I choose here to override the variables. A standard programming approach would use new variables. However, the learner reserves memory on the GPU. We will hit an out of memory error. One option is to delete the previous variable and free up the memory. The other option, which I chose here, is to override it with a new learner. This override implicitly deleted the old learner.\n\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=accuracy)\n\nWe will pull another trick and use a better learning rate.\n\nlearn.lr_find()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestedLRs(valley=0.0014454397605732083)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlearn.fine_tune(16, 1.44e-3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n4.298504\n2.772096\n0.278049\n00:02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n3.559263\n2.476911\n0.331707\n00:02\n\n\n1\n3.395612\n2.182159\n0.370732\n00:02\n\n\n2\n3.096542\n1.812795\n0.492683\n00:02\n\n\n3\n2.789779\n1.489513\n0.570732\n00:02\n\n\n4\n2.507986\n1.255989\n0.629268\n00:02\n\n\n5\n2.255753\n1.103503\n0.687805\n00:02\n\n\n6\n1.996111\n1.050033\n0.726829\n00:02\n\n\n7\n1.788129\n0.995375\n0.741463\n00:02\n\n\n8\n1.612162\n0.972283\n0.741463\n00:02\n\n\n9\n1.448160\n0.921064\n0.736585\n00:02\n\n\n10\n1.303951\n0.902030\n0.751220\n00:02\n\n\n11\n1.197405\n0.879721\n0.765854\n00:02\n\n\n12\n1.133353\n0.869218\n0.760976\n00:02\n\n\n13\n1.073917\n0.860385\n0.775610\n00:02\n\n\n14\n1.003178\n0.850505\n0.770732\n00:02\n\n\n15\n0.972047\n0.851660\n0.775610\n00:02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlearn.fine_tune(6, 1.44e-3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.824386\n0.848143\n0.780488\n00:02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.778520\n0.854400\n0.780488\n00:02\n\n\n1\n0.784403\n0.840095\n0.770732\n00:02\n\n\n2\n0.752580\n0.833080\n0.760976\n00:02\n\n\n3\n0.711079\n0.824473\n0.775610\n00:02\n\n\n4\n0.661186\n0.804503\n0.760976\n00:02\n\n\n5\n0.619942\n0.800512\n0.765854\n00:02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlearn.fine_tune(6, 1.44e-3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.536938\n0.783610\n0.775610\n00:02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.553907\n0.786242\n0.775610\n00:02\n\n\n1\n0.547560\n0.848543\n0.765854\n00:02\n\n\n2\n0.524134\n0.848381\n0.756098\n00:02\n\n\n3\n0.499666\n0.811153\n0.780488\n00:02\n\n\n4\n0.473074\n0.783625\n0.780488\n00:02\n\n\n5\n0.465626\n0.781733\n0.785366\n00:02\n\n\n\n\n\nThe training advanced more slowly. It seems to have hit the same block at 76%, 77%. Only after 12 more iterations, we seem to have converged on a path with over 78%. The Validation loss is only going down after 6 iterations, showing convergence issues of the gradient descent.\nLet’s look at the solution\n\ninterp = ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(learn)\ninterp.plot_confusion_matrix()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninterp.plot_top_losses(5, nrows=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fourme d'ambert uncertainty has almost vanished. The top losses are from images that have slipped my cleaning efforts and are indeeed misleading.\n\n\n5.3 Label smoothing\nAs the data still has a lot of noise, we can try label smoothing. Labelsmoothing assumes a natural uncertainty and no label can have 100%. Instead, Label smoothing redistributes a small portion of the correct class’s probability across all classes to prevent overconfidence and improve generalization.\nWe will start with 28 iterations.\n\nfrom fastai.losses import LabelSmoothingCrossEntropy\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=accuracy, loss_func=LabelSmoothingCrossEntropy())\n\n\nlearn.lr_find()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestedLRs(valley=0.00363078061491251)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlearn.fine_tune(28, 3.6e-3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n4.273853\n2.742732\n0.307317\n00:02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n2.933313\n2.152079\n0.429268\n00:02\n\n\n1\n2.757924\n1.957854\n0.531707\n00:02\n\n\n2\n2.600373\n1.795183\n0.595122\n00:02\n\n\n3\n2.414058\n1.652869\n0.648780\n00:02\n\n\n4\n2.251830\n1.555603\n0.692683\n00:02\n\n\n5\n2.109990\n1.569267\n0.702439\n00:02\n\n\n6\n1.985083\n1.525316\n0.717073\n00:02\n\n\n7\n1.878232\n1.548784\n0.717073\n00:02\n\n\n8\n1.782599\n1.508083\n0.726829\n00:02\n\n\n9\n1.692580\n1.468358\n0.746341\n00:02\n\n\n10\n1.610464\n1.430262\n0.741463\n00:02\n\n\n11\n1.544696\n1.419962\n0.721951\n00:02\n\n\n12\n1.477807\n1.413017\n0.751220\n00:02\n\n\n13\n1.419630\n1.305687\n0.760976\n00:02\n\n\n14\n1.370959\n1.298595\n0.795122\n00:02\n\n\n15\n1.320189\n1.298479\n0.814634\n00:02\n\n\n16\n1.275702\n1.271670\n0.785366\n00:02\n\n\n17\n1.247922\n1.282414\n0.770732\n00:02\n\n\n18\n1.205016\n1.259176\n0.775610\n00:02\n\n\n19\n1.168169\n1.248492\n0.775610\n00:02\n\n\n20\n1.135880\n1.244297\n0.780488\n00:02\n\n\n21\n1.108426\n1.244742\n0.785366\n00:02\n\n\n22\n1.088607\n1.238094\n0.775610\n00:02\n\n\n23\n1.073189\n1.241032\n0.780488\n00:02\n\n\n24\n1.053456\n1.239150\n0.775610\n00:02\n\n\n25\n1.044365\n1.244962\n0.780488\n00:02\n\n\n26\n1.034709\n1.242740\n0.780488\n00:02\n\n\n27\n1.029999\n1.233360\n0.790244\n00:02\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting at iteration 13, issues emerged with the loss function.

Whereas the smaller model generalizes better on a smaller dataset.\nResearch has also shown this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_scaling_law.\nLarger models often perform better with more data because of their capacity to learn complex patterns, while smaller models may generalize better on smaller datasets, reducing overfitting.\n\n\n6.4 Label smoothing\nWe will try the size together with the label smoothing.\n\ncheese = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), \n    get_items=get_image_files, \n    splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),\n    get_y=parent_label,\n    item_tfms=RandomResizedCrop(312, min_scale=0.3),\n    batch_tfms=aug_transforms(mult=2))\ndls = cheese.dataloaders(\"working/which_cheese_cleaned\")\nlearn_better = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=accuracy, loss_func=LabelSmoothingCrossEntropy())\n\n\nlearn_better.lr_find()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestedLRs(valley=0.0014454397605732083)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlearn_better.fine_tune(20, 1.4e-3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n4.394593\n2.871440\n0.229268\n00:04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n3.653049\n2.588406\n0.317073\n00:05\n\n\n1\n3.530752\n2.326544\n0.365854\n00:05\n\n\n2\n3.368824\n2.011567\n0.502439\n00:05\n\n\n3\n3.158019\n1.743854\n0.590244\n00:05\n\n\n4\n2.937979\n1.583111\n0.668293\n00:05\n\n\n5\n2.703008\n1.478423\n0.707317\n00:05\n\n\n6\n2.499692\n1.461678\n0.785366\n00:05\n\n\n7\n2.328650\n1.402460\n0.770732\n00:05\n\n\n8\n2.176972\n1.380992\n0.760976\n00:05\n\n\n9\n2.045058\n1.355799\n0.751220\n00:05\n\n\n10\n1.940953\n1.329172\n0.780488\n00:05\n\n\n11\n1.850078\n1.313228\n0.809756\n00:05\n\n\n12\n1.770922\n1.311223\n0.809756\n00:05\n\n\n13\n1.706659\n1.292058\n0.819512\n00:05\n\n\n14\n1.641106\n1.296595\n0.800000\n00:05\n\n\n15\n1.590719\n1.295866\n0.814634\n00:05\n\n\n16\n1.561213\n1.287696\n0.800000\n00:05\n\n\n17\n1.523102\n1.286888\n0.809756\n00:05\n\n\n18\n1.498262\n1.279946\n0.809756\n00:05\n\n\n19\n1.474353\n1.274973\n0.814634\n00:05\n\n\n\n\n\nSadly the LabelSmoothing only improved the convergence.

What we want is a live version of the model. Something users can experience.\nYou can deploy via cloud computing or on-device/edge computing. The used technologies are different.\n\n9.1 Cloud based deployment\nYou cannot evaluate PyTorch ML models using simple JavaScript. A server runs a python backend, which provides an endpoint that is only doing the code of the previous section.\nHere is a good tutorial how to get a simple setup running on hugging face with gradio.\nI developed a webcam based app; the code is in the repo. And the app is live.\nIn the app you can select the convnext-base, convnext-tiny and the resnet model. All models are trained with 256px images. Just point the camera towards a cheese.\nI used the Gradio framework, popular in ML and featured on Hugging Face. The processing takes several milliseconds, despite being server based. The Gradio app offers no frame dropping. I try to include dynamic throttling to avoid frame congestion.\nOne thing I observed from this app is that the Convnext models have high numbers for the second and third best candidate. The app tries to predict a cheese when there is no cheese present. Two points worth to examine.\n\n\n9.2 Edge based deployment\nThe issue with edge-based deployment is python. Python is by default not available on mobile. And because of secure concerns, it is becoming more and more complex to run a full blown linux with a python installation.\nThe other two ways are mobile apps and browser-based inference. We limit ourselves to browser based, because this is accessible via desktop and mobile.\nONNX format is necessary for web browser model deployment. At the end of this, we will evaluate if inferring onnx gives us the same probability. Due to differences in preprocessing between fast.ai and manual methods, some variations may occur.\nUsing my knowledge of web development, I constructed a basic app that does inferring the resnet model.\nMy impressions were that the results were less good. But, the startup and inference time were acceptable and comparable to the python app. This is a point worth to examine once I have defined a proper test set."

If you are only interested in results, skip it and go to part II.\n\n2.1 Software engineering is about reading code\n\nThere are 10 types of people in this world, those who understand binary and those who don’t.\n\n\n2.1.1 What Beginners and Non software Developers do not get\nA novice expects that developing software is all about writing code. And I have to admit that just hacking away can initially feel good. Directly coding and doing everything from scratch feels so powerful. The raw power is just at your fingertips. You are the wizard of the computer - in then end you will pay dearly. You get stuck in the mud of your code. This is blind activism.\nLarge companies are not immune to this. In fact, sometimes the management structure incentivizes quick hacks and fast coding over constant architecture development.\n\n\n2.1.2 The role of non-software people\nThe rise of non-code application and then the onset of the hype of LLM in 2022 have led to the fear that programming and software developers have no future. In the future, anybody can code. Personally, I disagree with this. My argument is not purely based on self-preservation. Instead, I believe AI can replace that simple apps that were done before by a single developer. However, the software engineers concerned will move to bigger projects. Similar as we do not know every single assembler instruction or binary instruction, we might no longer know every single code line in our precious masterpiece.\nTeams will focus on higher value tasks or just be quicker in developing new features. Engineers will focus more on higher-level tasks: system engineering, architecture and customer interaction. There could be a conversion of specialized engineering roles. The same team might do requirements, design, Code, and testing. Concentrating multiple roles on fewer staff. The cost of friction in human interactions will do the rest. The excessive cost of inter-team communication outweighs specialized teams’ remaining advantages. But until we get there, it will be a few more years with a lot of unforeseen changes.\n\n\n2.1.3 We always face new code\nAs we learn more and more during our journey as software developers, we discover reading code is far more important than writing. Usually we read someone else’s code and try to understand it.\nFor consulting-work or a short-term project, this is obvious.\nIf you always work on the same enormous project, you need to switch assignments and will work on different components. In fact, a dynamic and growing software business will always need to pivot the existing engineering staff to other tasks. Just hiring new engineers is not cost efficient.\nEven when you work all by yourself. Remembering the details of your code becomes difficult after about six months.\nSo regardless of your works nature. If you are productive, you will frequently encounter new code which needs to put into your works context. We need to understand if the code is doing what it should do. Figuring out what it should is about as hard as ensuring that it is doing this.\nThat is why I believe software engineers can not be replaced. Problem discovery and formulation is currently engrained in the process of writing code. Removing or simplifying the process of writing, will not remove problem discovery and formulation.\n\n\n\n2.2 How we approach unknown code\n\n2.2.1 Missing documentation makes it harder\nSadly, not all codebases have perfect documentation. The more innovative the business is, the more it will rely on exploration. Often, the original creator quickly produced and then abandoned his software. Take open source source software. While there are many gems with an outstanding code standard, there are as many counterexamples. Even more, even a perfectly documented code, becomes difficult to use if relies on a framework and there are major shifts in the framework.\nOne such shift is the change from Python 2 to Python 3. Projects can go stale as it becomes more difficult to update them.\nThe lack of documentation and especially lack of documented software architecture profoundly hinders grasping the code from a top-down perspective. The only solution, dig through the code.\n\n\n2.2.2 Poorly designed software takes a long time to understand\nPoorly written software may have suboptimal abstraction and encapsulation.\nAn example: Because of performance issues, it can be necessary to use a data structure as an input/output parameter. However, while this is comfortable, it increases code complexity dramatically. This mechanism invites us to just pass on a massive data structure and change a bit about it. Take enough of these functions and complexity will blow up in your face. A similar code smell is the god object. In such a class, side effects are none-obvious.\nThe only way to uncover the hidden connections is to read the complete code and keep track of the connections and dependencies which are important to you. Even with a modern IDE (search, find usage), this remains a very time-consuming task.\n\n\n\n2.3 SOLID principles and model-based system engineering\n\n2.3.1 Towards a clean architecture\nWhile I read about the importance of SOLID principles and good architecture in Clean Architecture, I thought about the code I produced myself. Where did I not apply these principles?\nMy biggest programming sin is definitively the code that I wrote during my PhD. A non-linear finite element solver, with different material models and integration schemes.\nIt lacked so many things. While it had classes, it did not obey all SOLID principles. In particular, it violated dependency inversion. The most abstract classes depended usually on the most concrete classes. For example, instead of using a high level builder, an intermediate level featured flags to select the proper material model. This whole architecture made it quite difficult to test the code. Of course, it did not matter to me, as the thoughts of code coverage and TDD had never crossed my mind.\nNow, having done a in-depth study of ‘Clean Architecture’ and the details about dependency inversion, I wanted to make a clean architecture for my FEM solver.\nI did not even know where to start. Of course my code had an architecture. The architecture had, however, mostly grown organically.\n\n\n2.3.2 Model based engineering\nAs a software developer, I’ve grown fond of using simple Mermaid or PlantUML diagrams. These small diagrams are more formal than paper-based drawings, while still allowing enough freedom to detail the abstractions. UML is the go to tool to formalize your architecture.\nChoosing a pure paper based approach or digital paper in form of text files, one faces the issue to keep source and documentation always in sync.\nIt was when working on a large-scale project with a dedicated modelling team; I learned about model-based system engineering. Tools like Enterprise Architecture can generate code from UML diagrams. Some of those tools can even analyse your code and create UML diagrams.\nAs a result, you get two views on the same software. One abstract (UML/SysML) and one very concrete (Code). The computer takes care to keep both in sync.\nThe abstract system models are usually consistent over several abstraction levels. However, the connection to code only happens at the lowest level. If the connection were to happen on any level, these models could act as the zoom button for the software.\nThe major drawback? Usability. Nowadays, software engineers use an IDE. And once being accustomed to their favourite IDE, they do not want to leave it.\nTools like Enterprise Architect have a steep learning curve, while not having any of the features a modern IDE has. In practice this seems not important. Many safety-aware businesses using model-based system engineering create special roles dedicated to these tools. This introduces the drawback of splitting the model and the code over two people instead of bringing everything closer together.\nIn addition, these tools can be pricey. A no-go for small to medium-sized projects.\nAnother alternative I discovered is the C4 diagram https://c4model.com. There are some projects that aim to automate the creation https://structurizr.com/.\n\n\n\n2.4 The two-way problem of model-based engineering\n\n2.4.1 Forward: Code to diagrams\nGenerating diagrams from code is state-of-the art. In the following I will only dive into the tools for this usage. Most of the time, tools focus on the class at hand or automatic generation of class diagrams over several classes.\n\n\n2.4.2 Backward: Diagrams to code\nThe other way round generating code from diagrams can be much more difficult. Existing system engineering tools can do this. Correct application of MBSE, in fact, results in very detailed diagrams; the model has already gathered all the information. Therefore it is easy to afterwards generate template based modules. This was actually not my idea when I thought about abstraction and a zoom button. As a side node, doing so usually leads to a schism between software engineers and system engineers. In addition, the lack of connection between the two tools usually results in duplicated information.\nA better approach could be the use of multimodal large language models. In an ideal world, we would draw a diagram and describe what we want. The computer would adjust the diagram to the correct constraints and then implement the code. Currently, in 2025, that is not how code generation works, even though the field is moving fast. The part of the constraints is lacking.\nThere are disadvantages to this approach. First, such diagrams would need to be flexible enough to facilitate discussion with all stakeholders. Discussions often leave out important details. Potentially, by writing done these assumptions, a LLM could take care of adding the abstracted information in the diagram.\nSecond, Model-based engineering enforces formalism, leading to better performance through standardized solutions. However, for the highest performance, we usually need to cut corners. This requires the direct modification of the code by us. That again would be the other direction again. Depending on the domain, it could be faster to directly write the code yourself."

    "text": "3 Part II: capturing all dependencies in one diagram\nWhen I looked into the subtopic of code to diagrams, I focused on Python. Static-typed languages like C++ are even better for code analysis because of the explicit typing in the code. Many C++ programmers use doxygen extensively. For Python, the code needs to have type hints, for everything beyond base types.\nI found a few open source tools: Pyreverse, Pynsource and Py2Puml. As I explain below, Py2Puml is the best one. However, it falls short in the documentation of class methods. Not really satisfied with the output, I wrote some modifications. Finally, I considered how to better caputure dependencies using graphs. That is why I wrote Py2Graph.\n\n3.1 Meet our guinea-pig package: Productworld\nTo evaluate the different programs, I came up with a simple package: Productworld.\nBelow, you find the package structure and the full code.\nImportant to me was the use of an abstract class and the occurrence of the other classes in signature, member list, and function bodies. I also wanted free functions to be documented. Regardless how important, free functions do not exist in a standard UML class diagram. So I expected the tools to fall short here.\n\n3.1.1 Packages and Components\n\nproductworld/\n├── base/\n│   ├── base.py\n│   └── customer.py\n└── products/\n    └── products.py\n\n\n\n3.1.2 The full code\n# base.py\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod  \n  \nclass Product(ABC):  \n    def __init__(self, product_id, name):  \n        self.product_id = product_id  \n        self.name = name  \n  \n    @abstractmethod  \n    def get_price(self):  \n        pass  \n  \n  \nclass NewOrder:  \n    def __init__(self, order_id, product: Product, quantity):  \n        self.order_id = order_id  \n        self.product:Product = product  \n        self.quantity = quantity  \n  \n    def calculate_total(self, product:Product)-&gt;int:  \n        return self.product.price * self.quantity  \n  \nclass Order:  \n    def __init__(self, order_id, product:Product, quantity):  \n        self.order_id = order_id  \n        self.product = Product()  \n        self.quantity = quantity  \n  \n    def calculate_total(self)-&gt;int:  \n        return self.product.price * self.quantity  \n  \n          \ndef fancyFunc(order: Order):  \n  return 42  \n  def funkyFunc():  \n return 42\n\n\n# customer.py\nfrom typing import List  \n  \nfrom productworld.base.base import Order,fancyFunc, NewOrder  \n  \n  \nclass Customer:  \n    def __init__(self, customer_id, name):  \n        self.customer_id = customer_id  \n        self.name = name  \n        self.orders = []  \n        self.newestOrder :NewOrder = NewOrder()  \n  \n    def add_order(self, order: Order):  \n        self.orders.append(order)  \n        self.orders.append(NewOrder())  \n        fancyFunc(order)  \n  \n    def get_total_spent(self)-&gt; int:  \n        return sum(order.calculate_total() for order in self.orders)\n\n# products.py\nfrom productworld.base.base import Product  \n  \nfrom productworld.base.base import funkyFunc  \n       \nclass PhysicalProduct(Product):  \n    def __init__(self, product_id, name, price):  \n        super().__init__(product_id, name)  \n        self.price = price  \n  \n    def get_price(self):  \n        return self.price  \n  \nclass DigitalProduct(Product):  \n    def __init__(self, product_id, name, price, discount):  \n        super().__init__(product_id, name)  \n        self.price = price  \n        self.discount = discount  \n        funkyFunc()  \n  \n    def get_price(self)-&gt;int:  \n        return self.price * (1 - self.discount)   \n          \nclass Productfactory():  \n def create_product(self,pid:str)-&gt;PhysicalProduct|DigitalProduct:  \n   return PhysicalProduct()  \n     \ndef create_product(self,pid:str)-&gt;PhysicalProduct|DigitalProduct:  \n  return PhysicalProduct()\n\n\n\n3.2 Existing tools\n\n3.2.1 Pyreverse\nPyreverse is part of Pylint and allows you to create an UML diagram for your code.\nIf you have Pylint installed, you can easily run it with the following command:\npyreverse  -ALSmy  -o puml     --verbose . \nWhat works well:\n\nInheritance is correctly captured\nAggregation is correctly captured\nArgument and return types are identified\n\nWhat does not work:\n\nPackages and components are not shown\nArgument and return type dependencies are not resolved\nIt is a pure UML Class diagram, therefore free functions are not covered\nUsage of classes in function body is not covered\n\nThis is the picture I got:\n\n\n\nPyreverse is a good start, but lacks critical connections\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Pynsource\nNext I tried Pynsource, which offers a GUI. Adding new files is cumbersome. It’s impossible to update a complete model. Overall, I do not recommend this. The result is worse than Pyreverse.\nWhat works:\n\nInheritance is correctly captured\nAggregation is captured as a normal dependency\nUsage of classes in function body is covered as dependency\n\nWhat does not work:\n\nPackages and components are not shown\nArgument and return type dependencies are not resolved\nIt is a pure UML Class diagram, therefore free functions are not covered\nMember types are not identified\n\nIn the free version, no saving of the UML file is possible, only a screenshot.\n\n\n\nPynsource has even less information\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Py2puml\nFinally, I tested Py2puml.\nWhat works:\n\nInheritance is correctly captured\nAggregation is captured as a composition\nMember types are identified\nPackages and components are not shown\nAbstract class is correctly shown\n\nAs I am focused on a clean architecture with dependency inversion, the correct capture of the abstract class is strong plus.\nWhat does not work:\n\nClass methods are not shown and as such, no argument and return type dependencies are resolved\nIt is a pure UML Class diagram, therefore free functions are not covered\nUsage of classes in function body is not covered\n\nOverall, I like this the most. The packages reflect the driectories and the components the files. The notion of different levels can be found in this picture.\n\n\n\nPy2puml provides us with information on the module structure, but missing class methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 My Contribution\nAs highlighted above, none of the programs clearly delivered what I wanted to do.\nMy favourite was Py2Puml. First, I addressed its major drawback: missing functions.\n\n3.3.1 Py2puml with methods\nLuckily for me, there is a py2puml fork that tries to deal with the class method. Details can be found in the pull requests for the py2puml, here.\nUnfortunately, the structure of py2puml has changed since the fork date, and the merge is not that straightforward. The PR remains in limbo for 2 years.\nI performed a rudimentary merge of this fork, but this clearly ruined my secondary goal of finding something suitable for production, not just a hobby. I now have loaded myself with a vast pile of technical debt.\nMy code is often a mixture of classes and free functions. Therefore, I collect all free functions in Annotation called Methods. Such an annotation exists in every component, every file. Some other minor changes were done as well.\nThese changes addressed almost all the critical points of Py2Puml\nWhat does still not work:\n\nUsage of classes in function body is not covered\n\nThe picture is now much more detailed. There are several connections that did not exist before. The richness of this picture would allow us to add different zoom levels and options. We could clearly hide, for example, the usage of free functions within the same component. However, we should highlight usage across components.\n\n\n\nClass methods are back thanks to an old fork.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 The next level: Py2Graph\n\n3.3.2.0.1 Problem description\nThere remains the missing linkage of functions that are used within the body of another function. For an inspection, that is quite bad. By changing a class A that is used within the body of another class’ B function, we influence behavior of class B. This is exactly the sort of connection we are interested in and which should be visible. The question is Which classes does class A influence.\nThe second drawback is performance. Even on this tiny example, the Py2Puml requires almost 20 milliseconds. For something which should work in not much more than a few milliseconds, that is too long.\n\n\n3.3.2.0.2 Digging deeper\nThe reason is in the architecture of Py2puml. It basically collects lists and then merges them together. To correctly cover all dependencies, we need two passes on the entire codebase. First, we identify existing functions, and then we identify their usage within other classes.\nThe same issue applies for the function body. In theory that could also be made to work for the original approach using list.\n\n\n3.3.2.0.3 My Approach: Graphs\nI avoided these issues by using another data structure. Instead of using lists, I moved to a graph-based analysis.\nMy analysis first analysis all entities (files, modules, classes, functions, members) in hierarchical order. I create a graph node for every parsed entity.\nEdges link contained entities or types with their parent. So a module contains classes, which contain functions and members. This approach ensures coverage of connections within functions. Naturally, this analysis might not include the class used, thus preventing a link. This problem is the two pass issue, again.\nWe resolved the two-pass issue by using a placeholder node for expressions the parser had not yet visited. Once the parser analyzes the true entity, it replaces the placeholder node, but keeps its connections.\nIf placeholder nodes remain, that is usually a sign that the expression is not from the package in analysis. The system suppresses placeholders in the output.\n\n\n3.3.2.1 Analysis of solution\nMy approach only took 3ms. The speedup actually surprised me. I attribute it to the more efficient implementation of networkx digraph, compared to manual parsing of list and dicts.\nThere can now be multiple relationships between two elements, as we distinguish usage in the class and usage in the class methods. The diagram is becoming more complex. This is exactly what I had in mind when I started my tjourney. It is far easier to reduce the full picture to something less than making sense of an incomplete picture.\nThe new connection is visible in the connection to base.base.fancyFunc and base.base.funkyFunc. Order is used byfancyFunc. But in the previous version both functions were not used by anybody. In the new version you can see that funkyFunc is used by DigitalProduct. Whereas fancyFunc is used by Customer.\nIn the final version of the code I changed to straight lines.\n\n\n\nUsage of a graph structure helps us to get the all connections.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2.2 A bigger example\nAs initially mentioned, my interest in reverse diagram generation stemmed from my FEM solver. I rewrote parts of it in Python to test how to implement dependency inversion. And how this would look like in the project class diagram. Just for the record, I provide the full view here.\n\n\n\nFull view of a python port of my FEM solver classes"

Remember my colleague who came up with the name zoom button? Clearly we need to run this in a more integrated fashion. It should be a zoom button on a current version of the software. That is why runtime is critical.\n\n4.1 Live preview\nIn Pycharm the PlantUML plugin can provide a live view of the UML text file.\nI implemented something similar: A live view that analysis the entire project.\nSaving triggers a new generation of the diagram.\nHere we have two screenshots: in the second I introduced self.newPrice = 100 to PhysicalProduct. Because of the slow render time, the change was instant. Type is correctly inferred as int from using 100.\n\n\n\nScreenshot before the manipulation\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot after adding a member variable\n\n\nThe implementation works by watching for file changes and running a docker image with PlantUML.

The Server returns the image to the frontend for Display.\n\n\n\nDeployment view of the live mode\n\n\n\n\n4.2 The complete zoom button\nI set out to develop the zoom button. Clearly, by showing a more complete picture with all modules, component, and dependencies, we have done the first step. What is missing now is too selectively show information.\nThis would require to drop certain information from the graph and then send it to the render server. Highlighting a class’s influence zones would be acccomplished the same way. Thanks to the graph-based structure, we only need to carry out these steps on a graph, not on lists or text files.\n\n\n4.3 Going beyond the zoom button\nWhat else could be done.\nA call graph or a natural language model can auto-generate sequence diagrams, visualizing data flow as in LabVIEW/Simulink.\nIf any of these applications are interesting to you, just drop me a message and let’s discuss.\nSources for the Py2Puml mod\nSources for Py2Graph"

Even with a local tool like Pytesseract, the results are very good. If more than 50 words are detected, that’s a text page.\nThe solution works but is slow as OCR favors high resolution images.\nIn this notebook I will try to deliver a CNN-based classifier that should run quicker while still achieving high accuracy."

    "text": "2 Deep learning to the rescue\nI trained a first model based on existing scans I had available. Due to copyright restrictions, the dataset is not public.\nFor the future, each user could build their own dataset. The initial samples can be selected by the OCR pipeline or the user clicking. Then a classifier is trained. Once it is accurate enough, we switch the pipeline to the quicker CNN classifier.\n\n\nCode\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\nfrom fastcore.all import *\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageOps\nset_seed(42, reproducible=True)\n\n\n\n2.1 Cleaning the data with help of the first model\n\n\n2.2 Choice of model and setup\nBefore we dive into different options for modeling, we will do a quick pass through the data and see which images do not fit well. The data has two categories image_page or text_page. The dataset is balanced with 330 image pages to 355 text pages. We will therefore stick to accuracy as metric.\nWe use 20 % validation data. The images are too big for the net. Therefore, we resize to 192 px. We pad to preserve aspect ratio. Rotations are dealt with on loading.\nFor the first pass we choose resnet18.\n\ndef correct_exif_orientation(fn):\n    img = Image.open(fn)\n    return ImageOps.exif_transpose(img)\n\npages = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock),\n    get_items=get_image_files,\n    splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),\n    get_y=parent_label,\n    get_x=correct_exif_orientation,\n    item_tfms=[Resize(192,method='pad', pad_mode='zeros')]\n)\n\nLet’s load our data and inspect.\n\ndls = pages.dataloaders(\"data/raw/\")\ndls.show_batch()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe define a learner and fine-tune.\n\nset_seed(42, reproducible=True)\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=accuracy)\n\n\nlearn.fine_tune(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.682892\n0.014835\n0.992754\n00:27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.063574\n0.009595\n0.992754\n00:26\n\n\n1\n0.044590\n0.019105\n0.985507\n00:28\n\n\n2\n0.031911\n0.012100\n0.985507\n00:28\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter three iterations we already have 100% accuracy.

The algorithm will just have memorized the formats of the books in the training data. In addition, it overfitted during the first run.\nWe will reserve one format for the validation set.

Ok, but somehow not that fascinating.\nLLMs usually provide the average answers. And average cooks do not have recipes with the certain sparkle. Skillful prompt engineering or follow-up prompts could certainly surface this information from the vast amount of training data.\nI think the main issue is one of uncertainty. You assume that there are special tricks for a recipe you do not know. But you do not know in what area of cooking they are: preparation, order of adding, temperature? Doing so requires often a very skillful intuition. In my experience, why expert programmers can get so much more from LLMs than beginners for programming? They have the intuition to ask the right questions."

    "text": "3 Idea: Let’s just chat about our recipes\nFor our recipes, the solution could be easier. We rephrase the question. Instead of asking for the generation of a new (unique) recipe, we ask just to select from a collection of known recipes. This assumes our recipe collection only has outstanding books and notes, but we do not remember where to look.\nWhat we would then do is a simple vector-based similarity search, which fits our request. Then we either just furnish the recipes or we make up a recipe based on the recipes we found. In the second case, it is much more likely that the answer contains the little extra we search.\nThe entire process of querying a database before generation is called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\nThis is something which can be done with local chat apps. Gpt4all can create embeddings for the recipes and use a generic chat to talk about them.\n\n3.1 Going beyond chatting\nBut wait, there is more we could do. When we create a meal plan and a shopping list, we create data. We could use that data.\nWhat if we had an agent? We could ask to generate plans for us based on our wishes. It could also check what weekly promotions exist or offer seasonal suggestions. Even better, you would know what you cooked last week. He could know what you like and could ask what you liked or disliked about last week’s meals.\nIt is like a personal chef. Only he does not cook. Maybe that could be an extension :-).\nThis article is not only about the history of the recipescanner. It is the kickoff to an endeavour to create an AI agent that chats with about recipes and meal plans."

    "text": "4 Getting to work\n\n4.1 Product engineering meets AI Agent\nThe general direction is clear. A software that does all the meal planning.\nWith all the hype about AI agent, we are going to build one.\nOne issue, what kind of tool should the agent actually work with. Integrating it with Paprika, my current app is too complex. I could certainly search for a basic recipe app and try to integrate it.\nOne key aspect of my workflow is the digitalization. Few to no apps have this in a way I want it. Therefore, I built a meal planner from scratch with Python and React.\nThere is some upfront work to generate the meal planned before getting to the actual LLM work.\nThe Versions I currently aim for:\n\nReplacement of current Paprika based workflow. Web-app for manual recipe handling via frontend. Basic chat app with different model providers (local for testing and online for better performance). Scanning and Recipe generation, as in the previous version.\nA Langgraph based chat app to talk about recipes in database and meal plans. RAG Chat.\nTrigger creation of new recipes and meal plans. Iterative workflow.\nTake nutritional and seasonal information into account. Diet plan. Backfill missing data in recipes.\n\n\n\n4.2 How to start\nBack to software engineering. In Do you know the hidden paths of your code, I talked about the importance of architecture.\nAnother question I follow in this project: LLMs are a big missing puzzle piece in creating better architecture, but how to use them effectively? With all the hype on AI code generation, I was quite optimistic. I would advance with the legacy part.\nAfter a lot of discussion, I asked ChatGPT to create a good starting prompt for my idea:\nYou are a senior full-stack engineer and AI-agent architect.  \nTask: walk me step-by-step through building a **chat-based weekly meal-planner** with these features:\n\n\n1. **Tech stack**  \n   - Python 3.12, FastAPI backend  \n   - Postgres + pgvector for recipes & embeddings  \n   - LangChain + LangGraph for an agent with a planning loop and persistent state  \n   - OR-Tools (or PuLP) to solve the nutrient/effort constraint model  \n   - React (Vite) chat UI\n\n1. **Core requirements**  \n   - take pictures and use google ocr to get json\n   - Ingest/parse recipe JSON → add tags, nutrition, effort minutes, fill a database entry. currently i use paprika recipes format to store data\n   - bulk mode for pictures\n   - Vector search for recipe Q&A (RAG node)  \n   - Planning node builds a 7-day plan that:  \n     • hits user kcal/macro targets ±10 %  \n     • caps hands-on cooking time per day  \n     • avoids any recipe used in the previous 3 weeks  \n   - Approval loop: if the user types “change”, the graph re-plans until accepted  \n   - On acceptance, write `meal_plan` table and return a shopping list grouped by aisle  \n   - Persist `recent_recipes` (rolling 21 recipes) and chat history in Redis\n   - ui: similar to chatgpt. left side menu and session overview. ability to browse through recipes. should work on desktop and mobile.\n\n3. **Deliverables to produce in this session**  \n   - High-level architecture diagram  \n   - Database schema SQL  \n   - LangGraph code skeleton with nodes and edges  \n   - Sample FastAPI route that streams assistant responses  \n   - Minimal React chat component calling the API  \n   - Docker-compose file for Postgres+backend\n\nGive concise explanations; focus on runnable code and folder structure. Assume I know the basics—skip introductions. After each section, wait for my “next” before continuing.\nIn stage 3, we already see the issue. The computer would dive directly into coding. With such an extensive project that would lead to a big mess.\nInstead, I spent some time on the architecture. You can find the details below.\n\n\n\nThe first version offered by the language model. Without diving into the details. There seem to be too many blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter some modifications I settled on this.\n\n\nThis leads me to the next big issue. Big bang building is equal to the Big bang integration. As such, we need incremental working versions.\nI kicked it off with a JetBrains AI Assitant do the coding. It started with the impressive generation of 47 files and a fully functional mocked frontend.\nWow, at that speed, I would finish in a week.\nWell,…\n…\nSpoiler for the next article. Not so fast. Remember: “The only way to go fast is to go well”. And it turned out the LLM does not go well for bigger projects."

Most of the above images reflect the ChatGPT results from early 2023 and 2024.\nOver the cause of time, the results of Dalle got better regarding image content. The shift from DALL-E 2 to DALL-E 3 accounts for this. See this comparison. . To me, the Dalle3 images seem sometimes less artistic. However, they are more accurate with regard to the prompt.\n\n\n21.3 The outdated art of prompt engineering\nIn 2023, the issue back then was to get the content correctly created regarding image content. I used prompt engineering to get ChatGPT to write correct prompts for Dalle.\nI first used ChatGPT to generate equations found in daily life, along with examples. Then I used it to create prompts for Dalle. I added an art style which I found fitting for the context.\nSome images required tweaking to be usable.\nNowadays, in 2025, the entire process works a lot more straightforward, but as already mentioned, all images look quite similar.\nThis leads to a . Is prompt engineering actually something someone should learn? Or is it quickly becoming outdated by the use of AI agents?\nI think it all starts with the creative process of noting your thoughts and expressing what is in your mind. If you do it on a computer or to another person, this could become very similar. For the people without the skills to craft the images themselves, it provides a better interface to the world.\n\n\n21.4 Comparison 2023 vs 2024 output\nI redid some images in 2024.

In Quarto, it is easy to generate an auto-created overview, so-called listings, for a directory. I use listings on my book reviews and projects overview pages.\nAdding the front matters was easy. Filing them with consistent content was more difficult.\nThe yaml front matter is necessary as it contains all the metadata. This data was previously in WordPress. I prefer this design as I now can change everything from within Obsidian. This mainly comprised creating yaml front matters for all my files.\nFor new Files, I have a script that adds a template.\n\n\n4.2 Using drafts\nDraft versions of blog post can be quite stable. Sometimes there is no time to finish an article, then again you want some time for the thoughts to age. The article remains in draft state.\nIn my WordPress workflow, I had two release gates. The first check occurs when copying from Obsidian to WordPress. I perform the second check before clicking “publish” on the WordPress interface.\nQuarto supports this draft state via the yaml front matter draft: true. You can render or hide drafts. The Quarto YAML defines this via.\ndraft_mode: visible\nFor the production version of my blog, I wanted no drafts. However, I found no way to change the behaviour quickly. Therefore, I decided on a custom deployment process via python script.\nUsually quarto only informs you that a post is a draft. There is no option to see all your drafts in a rendered version. I added a category draft, which gets set once the draft tag is true.\nAgain everything is done via python script.\n\n\n4.3 Output name\nWord press automatically shortens the title to something easily readable in the browser address page.\nMy zettelkasten files usually have the form: 202304170008 Decision paralysis at a McDonalds. The date shows when I created the note, not when I published the post.\nThe publishing date and the title is in the yaml front matter. I only need a easily readable webpage without spaces.\nI wrote a converter which makes this to decision-paralysis-at-a-mcdonalds for the output file.\n\n\n4.4 Dynamic Content\nAs stated before, I mainly use Obsidian. There are many discussions to get Quarto and Obsidian to work with each other, . However, none of the presented ways worked for me.\nOne enormous challenge is one of the USP of Quarto is the executing of code from the text files. To make this work, files needed to be qmd files.\nThere is an Obsidian extension: qmd as md. This plugin can currently just show the content of the file and allows editing via Obsidian. Obsidian search or graph do not work.\nI resolved the issue by naming my qmd files qmd.md. My integration pipeline then changes this to qmd for the rendering to work, as Quarto can only execute code in qmd not md files.\n\n\n4.5 Wiki links\nOne of the biggest issues is the linking. Obsidian uses wikilinks, Quarto uses Markdown links.\nI tried a lot of things: prerender script, lua filter. These approach failed because it violated the designs of Quarto: a to be rendered file can not be changed and the list of to be rendered files can not be modified by the prerender script.\nI settled on the wikilink to markdown Obsidian extension. It only lets you change one link. Changing Back does not correctly work. However, the backlinks and graph view show the markdown links correctly. The only tiring aspect is that the markdown link has %20 for spaces.\nThere is also the plugin: better markdown links. It offers more features, but did not work with my version.\nThe community seems onto this one. So I expect better results next year."

    "section": "5 Publishing with Quarto",
    "text": "5 Publishing with Quarto\n\n5.1 Draft & Publish Directories\nSo far I have been using Hostinger with a WordPress installation. Getting my work to the blog always required manual copies.\nThe main reason to switch to Quarto was that it streamlines this quite dump part of the entire writing process. In contrast, Quarto offers support for direct publishing from the repository to a GitHub Pages enabled repository.\nWhat sounds great at first sight, proofed to be rather difficult to get to work.\nFirst, I had the issues with the draft tag and the qmd files. I resolved this issue by introduction extra directories for draft and publishing. A script then runs through all the files and checks and syncs the files. To avoid any privacy leaks, theses directories are outside of my Zettelkasten. Drawback, rendering on render preview is not instant, but requires a manual copy. Future feature: a watchdog process could resolve this.\nI then review the publish directory and push it to git, where I have setup github actions.\nThe complete pipeline is:\n\nWrite in Obsidian\nUse a command to copy to draft or publish directory\nIn draft, do a render preview. Any subsequent copy just updates the file.\nDo it with the publishing repo\nExamine new content in git\nCommit and push\nGithub renders the repo\nGithub updates the blog\n\n\n\n5.2 Large Blogs\nI noticed that quarto takes some time to render large blogs. Sometimes, there are errors and I needed to delete the render. Which could mean rendering takes a lot of time. Luckily, quarto offers GitHub actions to render your blog on the GitHub server. This has two advantages:\n\nNot blocking your system with the final render\nEasier diff, as only md source needs review\n\n\n\n5.3 Privacy Concerns & Data Leaks\nGitHub only allows GitHub pages for public repositories. If you do not feel comfortable to push the raw data of the blog to a public repository, there is a solution.\nYou need two repositories. One to store the blog source files and the second to store the rendered files with static js.\nHere are the instructions to do this in a general case.\nTo sum up the benefits:\n\nSeparation of Concerns: Keep source files private while hosting the static site publicly.\nSecurity: Sensitive files in the source repo remain private.\nVersion Control: Build files are pushed only to the public repo without cluttering the source repo’s history.\n\nFor quarto a different GitHub actions file is required:\nname: Quarto Publish\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout source repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Setup Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n\n      - name: Configure SSH for deploy\n        run: |\n          # the deploykey is the private key. The public key is in the github pages repo\n          mkdir -p ~/.ssh\n          echo \"${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}\" &gt; ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n          chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n          ssh-keyscan github.com &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/known_hosts\n\n      - name: Render\n        run: |\n          quarto render\n\n\n    # Git task\n      - name: publish\n        run: |\n          # remove git history and settings - to avoid inheritance\n          rm -rf .git\n          # re-initialise git\n          git init\n          git config user.name \"name\"\n          git config user.email \"mail@mail.com\"\n          git branch -m main\n          git remote add origin git@github.com:$USERNAME/$USERNAME.github.io.git\n          # add and commit /docs/ folder\n          git add docs\n          git commit -m \"deploy the bundle\"\n          # push the commit to the public repository\n          git push -u origin main --force"

At the same time, it reduces the value of the credit or real money in your possession.\nThis shift means wealthy people get poorer. People living in a lot of debt get richer.\nPoor people usually live on their salary alone. In an ideal world, wages would be affected by inflation.\nEverybody wants more money, and people would stop working if exploited there.\nCurrently, this adaptation happens in many areas of the economy, like the healthcare and the restaurant industry. The salaries are too low for the work. There are more attractive jobs elsewhere.\nPeople working on sub-living wage is only possible in a feudalistic society relying on servitude and slavery. Many people will stop working, as basic social security is often a better option, even in the USA.\nThus, wages will catch up in the long run, or businesses will go out of business."

For business to business, the cost increases are often handed further to the next customer.\nWorkers usually cannot increase their price, that is, their salary directly. Instead, collective negotiations or finding a new job takes place. Small businesses currently have the same issues. If they increased their prices, their customers would stop coming.\nThe ability to increase the price relies on its own market power, also known as pricing power. To determine if you have pricing power, ask yourself, “Can you increase the price of whatever you sell”?\nPeople without pricing power see the exploitation of market power as unfair. They lose in the inflation game. Somebody else is making a huge gain, which is their loss.\nIf this did not happen, everybody would be in the same position after a complete cycle of increases.

The better alternative would have been designing for omni-dexterity, but the biases and norms of the time limited such foresight.\nSimilarly, AI and machine learning (ML) systems are shaped by the data they are trained on. Since humans select this data and curate it, the data carries the biases—conscious or unconscious—of its creators. And even if no selection is done, all available sources of the world are just an expression of human prejudices. The expectation that AI is inherently unbiased ignores the deep biases of humans."

You are annoyed if it is not as expected.\nAs the social norm shifted, people now feel entitled to work from home. Even without the best setup now, they expect they will have better equipment.\nRemoving the entitlement to working from will come with the same conflicts as removing entitlements to healthcare or retirement pensions.

Stories are the second best thing next to the experience. Stories act as a simulator, allowing the reader to live the story mentally.\nBut what makes a good story, and why are some stories better than others? Extensive literature exists on this topic, for example, the book storytelling animal.\nToday I want to write about what makes some stories more appealing than others and the role our mind plays."

    "text": "2 Be consistent with the reader\nWe commonly understand a story’s consistency to be within the story itself. But this is only one-half of the medal. Good stories arise if the consistency stretches from the past experiences of the listener over the entirety of the story.\nLong stories usually require a long time to achieve this consistency. Some books feel dull in the beginning. Slow. Nothing seems to happen. But suddenly, you find yourself sucked into it. Characters and actions become consistent.\n\n2.1 Bring the reader into the story\nOther stories, usually the better ones, directly relate to something in our daily life. Take, for example, Harry Potter. The first few pages of the first book describe the everyday life of many children. Every person can relate to these events. Fantasy elements only start appearing by and by, allowing us to catch up. Wands and flying brooms suddenly seem very consistent in this world."

Any full-blown confrontation with controversial facts will lead to strong resistance.\n\n3.1 Usage of shared experiences as priming\nImagine that you talk to climate change deniers. If you would state the experimental data and then open a discussion, you will only face a wall. However, if you slowly evoke memories of cold winters and emotional elements of increasing weather catastrophes, even the most outspoken deniers will start to discuss these events.\nThis effect is related to priming. You have set the baseline for your data by recalling singular events that may never have been an objective baseline. Recall today’s weather disasters and profoundly affect the listener’s consciousness. The vivid images will replace any memory of his comfy warm armchair.\n\n\n3.2 Usage of priming in your meetings\nA good example is the typical meeting check-in. You can ask everybody on Monday how he is feeling today. Many people are ignorant of those meeting tricks.\nBut you can influence the response by talking about something good that happened during the last work week. It is essential to speak of shared memory and direct the focus on positive thoughts. There is nothing to gain if you talk about your fancy weekend.\nIn addition, most people feel happier during their personal life than their professional life. The workweek memory establishes a positive baseline.\nUsually, people want to share something equally lovely or more admirable. As a result, they will focus on what was even more positive on their weekend."

Many situations are so new that the lack of feedback makes it difficult to make intuitive judgments.\nEven worse is the situation for business managers. Cases are rarely comparable, and there is always a new detail.\nThese experts often replace their lack of experience with confidence in their decisions. That, however, is a dangerous path.\nKahneman pointed out, “Judgments that answer the wrong question can also be made with high confidence.”\nConfidence in the own judgment is not a good diagnostic of accuracy. Next time your doctor tells you he is confident in your treatment, ask him how many patients with similar symptoms he had."

    "text": "Almost everyone agrees that you should read good books. Few people do. And even less are able to recall important lessons of the book after some time.\nHow to remember the content from good books? The usual approach is to summarize a book and extract its key lessons. Blinkist and many other summary websites splendidly do this.\nIn my opinion, this approach hinders us from learning from a book. Learning from books is mainly enabled by the exercise of written ideas. We can directly transfer the prescribed methods to our reality, like recipes from a cookbook.\nThis approach is limited when applied to more abstract topics such as management or thinking. Insights about thinking are difficult to understand and even more cumbersome to use.\nIn my opinion, the book is only a teacher. It can show you the general rules. But to digest the book, you must apply the rules to your own life. And the quickest way to do that is to write about such occasions. Writing is much more condensed than waiting for the next experience when you can apply the rules. By writing, you tell your own stories and create your own simulator.\nThe topics that interest me are software development, storytelling, self-improvement, and money.\nSo let’s talk about Thinking, Fast and Slow. I read the book in 2021, and spend most of the year of 2022 to come up with article ideas. I think it is a fantastic book, which anybody ought to have read, as it deepens your understanding of the human mind. Kahneman, who died this year, got the Nobel prize for his work and this book contains much of his knowledge."

You spent hours in front of it, only to resurface and see that you were solving the wrong issue. Why that is so can be learned in: Experienced engineers stay away from the flow zone\nAt some point in your career, you have to decide. Do you want to be an expert or remain a generalist? As a decision help, Look at your industrys state and then decide if you want to become an expert.\nMost engineers dislike PowerPoint and the management presentations that go along with it. There is a reason for it. As engineers, we are fond of small details. Later we wonder why our reporting is not well received. What you should do instead can be learned in Why engineers do not understand stories.\n\n\n1.2 Planning\nPlanning is everybody’s favorite activity in software development. Plannings are always off.\nWant to try something new? Try to establish your next planning predictions on well-defined reference points.\nStill, uncertainty is inherent to all software development. If too much complexity exists, tasks can not be well planned. Use risk policies and avoid common planning fallacies in software development\nAt one point in the planning cycle, we always refer to the experts to provide estimates. The issue is not whether you have good experts at hand, but if you should trust your real experts, Trust me; I am an expert.\nOnce a plan is done, we vote on it. High uniform confidence reveals a lack of trust. The SAFe confidence vote reveals the state of emotional security in your project.\nFailures settle the history of software engineers like skeletons on the trail through a desert.\nThorough planning should come before the pitching. It is never done so but would avoid failures. The perfect way that projects will never be planned.\nOne important aspect of planning is to control the success of the plan. Control with regard to efficiency of operation: are you doing all plan tasks. As well as control of effectivity: are the plan tasks doing the right thing. The last aspect is certainly the most challenging in planning and management. Many business books are successfully selling recipes how to deal with both challenges. Most of the time such recipes are biased by survivorship biased and overconfidence. Taylorism in complex environmentsdeals with the second aspect. Personal confidence does not replace a statistical analysis. Yet we often use KPIs to give our opinions a statistical backing.\n\n\n1.3 Management\nMany articles are trying to create a fissure between software developers and management. Some aspects might be accurate, but what also remains true? No software industry without leadership.\nI have three articles, one for the managers:\nGood managers are immune to survivorship bias. I wrote these articles in the post covid phase in 2022. At this time the back to office debate started.\nYou should go back to the office, to help your boss understand you\nMy last article is details why we will not all return to the office.

Interruptions of the zone are experienced as an annoyance. This comes done to a reduction of hormone release. While the exact processes are not yet fully understood, it is clear that the severe decline of endorphin release is experienced as an adverse event.\nThese negative emotions are undoubtedly destructive for you. It can also permanently affect your relationship to your coworkers. Their usually well-intended attempt to communicate with you provoked a negative feeling within you.

Two engineers who understand each other well and work in tandem can be so fixed on their solution that they forget the big picture.

They are surrounded by mountains of soft fabric and baskets brimming with buttons and thread, each according to the needs of their station. The rhythmic hum of sewing machines fills the air, harmonizing with the occasional steam whistle that punctuates the factory’s industrious atmosphere.\nOne morning the factory management realized that the output has dropped in the last week. The cause is immediately identified: the assembly station isn’t performing up to standard, as indicated by a decline in the relevant Key Performance Indicator (KPI). The bright manager of the factory quickly hires additional sewers to stitch the various parts of stuffed animals together. quickly restoring output to normal. The output quickly rebounds to its previous levels\nNow, picture a similar factory in a more modern setting. This factory produces a wide variety of toys to satisfy customers’ increasingly diverse desires.The manufacturing of toys takes place in semi-automated craftshop. Every craftsman makes the complete toy on its own. Each toy is sold with a unique label from the craftsman who made it.\nUnexpectedly, production slows down. Despite intensive investigation, no clear reason emerges.\nEventually, someone suggests that he is feeling cold and the cold winter weather might be to blame.\nThe management of the factory, equal bright than the previous one, feels ashamed. Poor workers can’t operate as efficiently with cold hands.\nWith much fanfare heaters are installed. And then the toy manufacturing goes on smoothly.\nHowever, one summer day, output declines once again.\nOnce again after thorough research, it’s discovered that there had been an unusually large volume of orders a few months prior in both occasions. Many of the craftsmen felt overworked and exhausted. However, the holidays were still months to go. The workers began working at a slower pace and took time for necessary tasks like tool maintenance. This reduced eagerness decreased their toy production time back to the previous level."

    "text": "2 The crux of management best practice\nWhat lessons can we glean from this story? The first time, the toy factory just got lucky. Often a new management initiative is celebrated inside a company. For some time this can lead to an increased motivation, until novelty wears off. After some months this forced motivation was wearing of and people start to think more towards a sustainable long term production.\nThe story from the cold craftsman was very convincing as it appeared coherent. Had the problem not recurred within six months, we might have concluded that keeping toy factories warm in winter is essential. Seasonal effects often can lead to wrong business decisions.\nBut the effect is even larger. Think about the other toy factories in the country. If our toy factory would have been successful, every toy factory would have adapted the process and installed much more heating power. The benefits would have been very low because toy factories are already warm in the first place.\nThis adaption of the wrong tool is a classic example of survivorship bias. The logic often follows that because successful companies adopt certain strategies, these strategies must be the key to their success. This is the statistical phenomenon where, if a variable is extreme on its first measurement, it will tend to be closer to the average on its next measurement. Essentially, every factory experiences phases where worker morale dips below average."

    "text": "3 Check the reliability of your KPIs\nTalyorism, more commonly recognized for its more benevolent name, scientific management, revolutionized the 20th Century. It is a management method, which uses resources and transforms them into outputs.\nAt the heart of scientific management is the meticulous control of processes through key performance indicators (KPIs) and the subsequent adjustments as needed.\nSuch a KPI can consist of anything that can be measured.\nNow what is the issue with applying KPIs to anything?\nMuch criticism has been done in the past. Authors such as Jerry Muller in “The Tyranny of Metric” or Kaplan and Norton with “The Balanced Scorecard” have provided in-depth analysis on this subject.\nTaylorism’s Application has significant limitations in complex environments. Its reliance on quantifiable data and rigid systems often classes with the need for adaptability and creative problem-solving. In fact, it is in these areas that human elements and modern management theories flourish. For instance, the issue with the low motivation could have been easily identified in a all-hands inspect-and-adapt session of agile management.\nIf you decide to go for KPIs, i want to shed some light on two hard factors: causality and statistical relevance. Firstly, a drop in a KPI should not be hastily attributed to mere coincidence. KPIs are usually designed on a whiteboard with a top down breakdown. So while a vertical hierarchy might be established, there is usually no link between lower level KPIs.\nMerely identifying a KPI and attempting to rectify it may prove insufficient. The causal story that can be constructed with a KPI is sometimes not enough.\nSecondly, the importance of statistical significance cannot be overstated. Just measuring the output results to a single data point.\nWhile it may reflect reality, it represents a singular instance. It could be part of the normal variance.\nSo, how many data points suffice? Rule of thumb: aim for more than 10. For a waterproof analysis: ask your statistician for a error margin analysis."

There are two ways to cool down the job market, extreme events (corona and war) or via market control mechanisms.\nThe control mechanism means regulating the money supply. Setting it to infinite will lead to a labor shortage. Only allowing free cash flow to pay for work and drying up the funding will reduce labor in the short term.\nIn the long term, this is not necessarily the case, as is predicted by communism. We will all have work and high productivity without debt and free money. At least, that’s what I heard.\nEnter politics."

    "section": "4 Influencing the attention frame",
    "text": "4 Influencing the attention frame\n\n4.1 You and the audience\nIn a presentation, there is always a relationship between the speaker and the audience. They may both be of the same group or not. The speaker may want to influence the audience, or he is a teacher.\nThe topic and the structure of the speech are important. More important are often the audience’s prior knowledge and their feelings towards the topics. These conditions set the stage.\nWhat do you feel when you read the words:\nelectric cars, climate crisis, milk, golf ball, abortion?\nDo you have the same feelings and constant background thoughts for each word?\n\n\n4.2 Influencing the background thoughts\nAttentive listening is a challenging skill. Many people listen and directly think about what they have heard. They start processing and ordering the information. Direct processing allows us to anchor new knowledge with already existing concepts. However, it makes the reception of further information more error-prone. This kind of chatter in your head is hard to silence. The good news? You can assume that many in your audience are not listening. They will not spot minor errors in your reasoning.\nThere are different approaches to influence this chatter. Among these are your choice of words, the consistency of the information, and providing a sense of reliability.\n\n\n4.3 Activity words lead to activity.\nImagine you want to promote your newest fitness gadget and spread the ideas of a fitness lifestyle.\nYou face a crowd of average Joes and Janes. They are familiar with the sport but know only a little about metabolism.\nHow do you set the stage for your pitch? Do you start with a lecture on the negative effect of fatty foods?\nFirst, you must invoke the need for action. Do this by using active words. Talk about how you love to go hiking on the weekend. This reminds the audience of their weekend activities. The audience is waiting for some action and will likely lapse over a statistical mistake.\n1 in 10 persons does not have a heart attack if he does sport. 2 in 10 persons of those use fitness gadgets. Fitness gadgets have a benefit.\nThis seems like a good deal. 2 are better than 1.\nAnother way to present the information would have been that 8 in 10 people are happy to do sport without gadgets. The data is essentially the same but less activating and does not fit the predisposition of the audience.\n\n\n4.4 Provide a consistent story\nA consistent story helps to reinforce any sentiments the audience had before. If you add details that do not fit, the audience becomes distracted. This is why so many scientists have a hard time presenting a good story. They want a complete picture describing any anomaly in the data.\nHowever, it is not the complete picture, but the most consistent that convinces. Almost nobody is interested in the story of Gandalf’s youth in the story of lord of the rings.\nA good story follows the concept that “What you see is all there is.” The speaker should reinforce this concept. The listener will automatically apply it. A consistent story is believed to be more accurate. This means consistency will lead to higher confidence in the speaker.\nAt the same time, a speaker that neglects details can also be more confident in himself. Daniel Kahneman explains this with our desire to see patterns:\n\n“Paradoxically, it is easier to construct a coherent story when you know little and when there are fewer pieces to fit into the puzzle. Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance”.\n– Kahnemann\n\n\n\n4.5 Providing a sense of (fake) reliability\nThere are mathematical formulas to express the accuracy of information. Intuitive sampling is often much too small and presents a systematic failure. Nevertheless, many sources only ask a few hundred people. Saying that 70 people asked 14 to use gadgets sounds far less impressive. The relevance is inflated by expressing it relative or in proportion to 10 or 100.\nTalking about ten people adds a level of detail to the narrative. 10 out of 100 people is better visualizable than 10 %. Detailed stories are, therefore, more persuasive. The same applies to the question “how many?” vs. “what percentage?”.\nFrom a statistical perspective, the inverse relation is true. More details make an event less likely and less likely to be true.\nMuch of business success stories and proven business methods rely on this approach. Success stories are cited as proof of a technique. One project’s success does not mean it is a suitable method for all projects. Still, this is an accepted approach in business writing and journalism."

    "text": "2 Why you should consider returning to office even if you think it is a bad idea\n\n2.1 Engineers are selfish\nAs an engineer, it is often preferable to think about one’s own needs. What works best for you? How do you get your work done? We prefer tranquil workplaces with a focused daily work schedule. The software developers’ work hell is a noisy environment with lots of spontaneous communication and interruptions.\n\n\n2.2 Manager vs. Maker\nSome articles try to explain why the management prefers working in the office and makers prefer to work from home, the maker vs. manager schedule. It comes down to schedule management and unplanned interruptions. This point is much more related to the current office culture and design.\nWere we all to have our private spaces and proper meeting planning, then there is little difference between the two schedule types.\n\n\n2.3 Management is not the problem.\nThe manager’s schedule only partly explains the manager’s preference for working in an office. After all, many project managers face distributed teams and external collaborators. They spent their day almost entirely on the phone. A more structured day with fewer interruptions is better in this setting.\n\n\n2.4 People management methods\nHowever, this neglects one thing. Most of today’s organizations are still power structures. Hierarchy is still predominant. Even flat hierachies are hierachies. Someone decides, and the majority has to play up.\nThis also includes performance evaluation.\nManagers need to gauge the performance of their associates. During the extended working-from-home periods, many managers saw their effectiveness decrease.\nWith Covid less threatening than before, they prefer to have everybody working in an office. But this is merely saying my trusted method does not work in a new situation; I want to return to the old position.\n\n\n2.5 Why classic supervision fails\nThe traditional evaluation methods fail due to availability bias. We only can judge things we are aware of. Humans tend to think of less visible people as less important.\nEverybody knows this mind trick: Failing to recall an instance of success means there is no success. Does it? This is why personal contribution always feels much more significant than it is in reality. We all are the best engineer of the team.\n\n\n2.6 We like what we know\nThis psychological bias always has been at play in office politics. It is one of the cornerstones of successfully managing your boss. Talk more to the boss, and his perception of yourself will be more present in his consciousness.\nEven more, this process is self-reinforcing. If you always talk to the same person, you have a specific preference for this person’s success. Compared with other people, you will expect your favorite to succeed better.\nPreventing such fallacies requires training and intensive reflection.\nBefore the massive working-from-home period, the brain was busy treating the mental load of daily office work. Reflection is usually the first thing to be abandoned.\nOnly as the in-office interactions dried up did most supervisors realize that they were left apart from what was happening and were less effective in doing their job.\nNaturally, the easiest thing to do is to go back to the office.\n\n\n2.7 The wise engineer is seen and known.\nSo as an engineer, it would be best if you went back to the office to give your supervisor a chance to evaluate your performance with his old methods.\nAs a supervisor, the task is much greater. You need to rise above yourself and overcome your biases and prejudices toward your employees. Give training and reflection the essential place that they deserve. Figure out how to effectively monitor performance during remote work."

    "text": "2 Knowledge is power: five techniques for dodging questions\nUnderstanding the various methods to avoid intellectual honesty is the first defense against manipulation in any discussion. After reading the five most common approaches, you can spot similar behavior in any toxic conversation.\nOne of the most common techniques to avoid answering a question is “dodging the question.” This can be done by completely ignoring the question or redirecting the conversation to a topic that is easier to discuss. For example, in a debate about the Clinton Foundation, Hilary Clinton might avoid answering the question by saying, “I did everything in this position to help our country. I am happy to talk about the Clinton Foundation.” While this response may be helpful in front of an audience, it does not address the question. Whenever somebody uses this technique, I feel frustrated and confused, as the original question was not answered, and the conversation was redirected to a different topic.\nA more offensive technique is attacking. This involves turning things around before the other person can ask the question. This can be done by accusing the other person of not asking the correct question or by making it appear as though the other person is being unfair or unreasonable. Doing this shifts the focus away from the actual topic and onto the other person’s behavior. In my experience, this often creates a hostile atmosphere and makes it difficult to continue a productive meeting.\nA slightly more subtle dodge involves choosing a keyword in the question and repeating it several times. This shows that the question has been answered, even if it has not. Similarly, responding with a joke diverts attention away from the topic. Whenever somebody opens with a joke I am left with a feeling of belittlement and that my questions do not have any value.\nIf the other side could have valid points, you can always talk them down. This involves discussing so many topics that the other person becomes overwhelmed and forgets the original question. This can be a very effective way to avoid answering difficult questions."

    "text": "4 How to measure beauty\nWouldn’t it be great if we could define a metric that tells us how good a picture is? How beautiful it looks?\nIn fact, there is a way to do this. We can use Aesthetic Predictor models. Let’s look at two such Models LAION and Aesthetic Predictor V2.5.\n\n4.1 LAION\nLAION is the older of the two models.\nIt is “a linear estimator on top of CLIP to predict the aesthetic quality of pictures.”\n\nBut how does it work?\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a multimodal model introduced in 2021. It’s based on\n\nA text encoder, usually GPT like\nA vision encoder, a vision transformer\n\nBoth encoders produce embeddings, and the model produces combined embeddings with a dimensionality of 768. CLIP was trained on image-caption pairs and used cosine similarity to align text and image embeddings as close as possible.\nThis allowed the model to identify the best caption for a given image, or vice-versa.\nLAION builds on top of CLIP, but scales it up to billions of images compared to clips 400 million.\nOn top of this embedding model, a linear regression model is trained using a much smaller dataset. The model is define by,\n\\[score= W * \\vec{emb} + b\\]\nWhere W and b are the weights and bias of the linear regression model.\n\n\n4.2 Aesthetic Predictor V2.5\nIn AI, four years is a long time.\nIn 2023 Google introduced SigLIP, Sigmoid Loss for Language–Image Pretraining.\nThe original CLIP model from OpenAI uses a contrastive loss function. Core to this function is a softmax over all image pairs. Even though all images can not be included at once, this is approximated using a very large batch size. This large batch size requires expensive compute hardware.\nAnother limitation of LAION was its the underperformance across diverse domains.\nSigLIP addresses both problems:\n\nFirst it uses a sigmoid loss function. Smaller batch sizes can be used.\nSecond it uses more data, being more robust to diverse domains.\n\nSo let’s check the aesthetic scores for our images.\n\n\n4.3 Calculating scores with Aesthetic Predictor 2.5\nWe will start with the newer model. Unfortunately, my GPU is too old and is no longer supported by PyTorch version required for this model.\nWe can use the Hugginface Api or CPU, though.\n\n4.3.1 Using the Hugging Face API for Aesthetic Predictor 2.5\n\n%%time\n\nclient = Client(\"discus0434/aesthetic-predictor-v2-5\")\n\ndef predict_with_ae25api(img_tensor, client):\n    img = to_pil(img_tensor.cpu())\n\n    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=\".png\", delete=False) as t:\n        img.save(t.name, format=\"PNG\")\n        return client.predict(image=file(t.name), api_name=\"/inference\")\n\nscores_api = [predict_with_ae25api(img, client) for img in images]\nprint(scores_api)\n\nLoaded as API: https://discus0434-aesthetic-predictor-v2-5.hf.space ✔\n['4.712978', '4.985875', '5.3126655', '5.0395384', '4.75456', '4.390934', '5.410819', '5.163789', '5.7570896', '5.6178026', '5.0622964', '4.242473', '4.695843', '5.7283096', '5.394037', '5.970618', '5.013522', '5.021712', '5.727453', '4.788595', '5.810698', '5.6538353', '5.338957', '5.173321', '5.7376328', '5.856394', '4.9087625', '5.0130215', '5.60766', '4.9622364', '5.304905', '4.6225524', '4.5034065', '5.2350173', '5.9285026', '5.1088295', '5.6992407', '5.356913', '5.652878', '5.0367103', '4.662853', '4.8960724', '5.1651015', '5.030403', '4.730472', '5.0686293', '5.6805077', '5.1905656', '5.3466654', '5.454918', '5.108632', '5.384975', '5.2946644', '6.0702987', '5.935483', '5.140892', '4.4770913', '4.819613', '5.5843506', '5.7856994']\nCPU times: user 14.3 s, sys: 432 ms, total: 14.7 s\nWall time: 4min 38s\n\n\n4 Minutes for the execution is quite long.

However, the approach is outdated and quite slow, making it not suitable for our purpose.\n\n6.1 U²-Net saliency map\nU²-Net is a deep learning model for salient object detection that uses a nested U-shaped architecture with Residual U-blocks (RSUs) for efficient multi-scale feature extraction.

We need to run the network with another input resolution. We can run several resolutions and decide which is best after scoring. A quicker approach is to examine the size of the main component in the picture, if it is too large we need to increase the resolution.\nTherefore, we define a function, which checks if we cover too much of the page with one component, where “too much” means 80%.\n\ndef _looks_like_full_page(sal, area_frac_thresh=0.80,require_border_touch=True):\n    \"\"\"Heuristic: is the biggest component huge and touching the image border?\"\"\"\n    S8 = (np.clip(sal * 255, 0, 255)).astype(np.uint8)\n    _, mask = cv.threshold(S8, 0, 255, cv.THRESH_BINARY + cv.THRESH_OTSU)\n    num, labels, stats, _ = cv.connectedComponentsWithStats(mask, 8)\n    if num &lt;= 1:\n        return False\n        \n    # largest component (skip background 0)\n    idx = 1 + np.argmax(stats[1:, cv.CC_STAT_AREA])\n    x, y, w, h, area = stats[idx]\n    H, W = sal.shape[:2]\n    area_frac = area / float(H * W)\n    touches = (x == 0) or (y == 0) or (x + w == W) or (y + h == H)\n    return (area_frac &gt;= area_frac_thresh) and (touches if require_border_touch else True)\n\nWith this function in place we can run a small optimization function. It will run over predefined scales and check if the result does not look like the full page. We start with smaller resolutions as these tend to produce the full page saliency map.\n\ndef run_u2_autoscale(model, image_np, sizes=(320, 480, 640, 896), device=\"cuda\"):\n\n    last_sal = None\n    for i, s in enumerate(sizes):\n        sal = run_u2_on_pil(model, image_np, s)\n        last_sal = sal\n        if not _looks_like_full_page(sal):\n            return sal\n            \n    # If even the largest still looks like a page, fall back to a small multi-scale fuse (max)\n    sal_big = last_sal\n    sal_small = run_u2_on_pil(model, image_np, sizes[0])\n    return np.maximum(sal_big, sal_small)\n\n\n\n6.4 The full pipeline\nNow with everything in place we can define a function that creates the fused saliency map, the bounding box, and finally crops.\n\ndef full_crop_pipeline(model, image):\n    transposed_image = np.array(ImageOps.exif_transpose(image).convert(\"RGB\"))\n    \n    sal_full = run_u2_autoscale(model, transposed_image)\n\n    # run edge detector\n    def rim_prior_from_L(image_uint8):\n        L = cv.cvtColor(image_uint8, cv.COLOR_RGB2LAB)[:,:,0]\n        gx = cv.Scharr(L, cv.CV_32F, 1, 0)\n        gy = cv.Scharr(L, cv.CV_32F, 0, 1)\n        mag = cv.magnitude(gx, gy)\n        mag = cv.GaussianBlur(mag, (9,9), 0)\n        mag -= mag.min()\n        mag /= (mag.max() + 1e-6)\n        return mag.astype(np.float32)\n\n    R = rim_prior_from_L(transposed_image)\n\n    # Fuse\n    S_fused = 0.85*sal_full + 0.15*R\n    \n    # Normalize\n    S_fused -= S_fused.min()\n    S_fused /= (S_fused.max() + 1e-6)\n\n    # Crop\n    cropped = crop_on_saliency_map(S_fused, transposed_image)\n    return cropped\n\n\ncropped_test_image = full_crop_pipeline(model, test_image)\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nplt.imshow(cropped_test_image)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected we get the same picture.\nLet’s calculate for all images and score.\n\ncropped_images= []\nfor file in tqdm.tqdm(files):\n    cropped_images.append(full_crop_pipeline(model, Image.open(file)))\n\n\nscores_laion_cropped = score_with_laion([to_tensor(img) for img in cropped_images])\n\n\nscores_laion_cropped.mean()\n\nnp.float32(5.951551)\n\n\nThis mean score is slightly better than the uncropped. let’s check the details.\n\nimprovement = (scores_laion_cropped-scores_laion_correct_orientation)\nimprovement.mean()\n\nnp.float32(0.07817339)\n\n\n\nimprovement.std()\n\nnp.float32(0.3198055)\n\n\nThe high standard deviation means some images improved a lot more, some got worse.

Personally I like the histogram equalization most. The inpainting has to strong artifacts in the non glare parts. There is too much contrast on the parts of the image which were not affected by the glare. With more work this could certainly be improved.\nFinally, my impression is that the LAION score is not good for our use case of food photography. The scores are too close together."

On of the most advanced segmentation models is (Segment Anything)[https://segment-anything.com/demo].\nFor a problematic image, the segmentation model gives the following result: \nHowever, identifying the best crop would require significant post- processing. Assuming we always look for dishes, which is not necessarily the case, we could look for smooth large shapes.\n\n\n7.2 Object detection\nBounding box object detection algorithms can, in theory, locate the plates quite well. The main drawback is that I would need to train such a detector myself, which requires a lot of labeled data.\nWhile there are backbones such as YOLO, we would still require several hundreds of labeled images.\nThis could be a viable refinement once a significant number of images has been processed.\n\n\n7.3 Direct optimization\nAnother possible approach is a brute-force optimization method. We would run an optimization algorithm that uses LAION to score the images. Based on the gradients we would vary the crop zone.\nHowever, from my experiments with saliency-based images, the aesthetic score is somewhat subjective and not always intuitive. To make this approach effective, the scoring function would likely need to be reworked. While there is certainly room for experimentation here, this method would require more research and fine-tuning."

OCR → Segmentation → Rules / Small Model\nExtract with OCR, Rules or DecisionTree for classification\n0.3 s on CPU\nCPU only, ~400 MB RAM\nScans are clean and structured\nLow\n\n\n\nFor pages with multiple recipes, the approach can be separated into two stages.\n\nImage to Text Blocks and recipe sections\nClassification of each recipe into ingredients, description, …\n\nThe division of the task into smaller tasks allows us to use less complex methods. In this notebook we focus on the task #1.\n\n\nNowadays, one straightforward solution is to run an LLM on the OCR output and ask it to cluster the text. You can even set up a complete workflow: cluster the text, check it, extract ingredients and instructions and the check again to ensure all content is used recipes are not mixed up.\nThe downside about all this? It is expensive to run. Especially if we introduce correctness checks. How much more expensive?\nFor reference, Google currently charges $1.5 per 1000 pages, whereas as Mistral asks for $3 per 1000 pages for annotated output. Google’s new interface, which (like Mistral) relies on Vision Transformers also charges asks for $1.5 per 1000 pages. Layout parsing costs extra at $10 per 1000 pages.\nLet’s say each of your users has about 2000 books he wants to convert. That results to $23 per user; and that is without classification. A custom extractor sets you back another $20. So the full workflow is about $50 per user. Again only for recipe extraction. Interaction with the recipe database will probably cost around $3 per month.\n\n\n\nI recently tested Docling, a transformer-based architecture. It has created quite a buzz recently.\nHere is my short evaluation. On the document which we are going to use throughout this notebook, it failed.

    "text": "When I first started working on recipescanner, the biggest issue was scanning multi column pages and multi recipe pages. How to group the output from the OCR scan in such a way that recipes are not mixed with each other?\nThe following table shows different options of workflows, from image to fully parsed recipe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nHow it Works\nSpeed (per page)\nNeeds\nBest When\nCost\n\n\n\n\n1. OCR → LLM Parsing\nExtract with OCR, LLM for classification\n3–5 s (small LLM)15–30 s (vision-LLM)\nGPU or strong CPU, few GB RAM\nLayouts are messy\nMedium\n\n\n2. Vision → Text (Donut / Pix2Struct)\nEnd-to-end vision does classification\n0.8–2 s on GPU\nGPU / NNAPI required\nHandwriting, warped images\nHigh\n\n\n3. OCR → Segmentation → Rules / Small Model\nExtract with OCR, Rules or DecisionTree for classification\n0.3 s on CPU\nCPU only, ~400 MB RAM\nScans are clean and structured\nLow\n\n\n\nFor pages with multiple recipes, the approach can be separated into two stages.\n\nImage to Text Blocks and recipe sections\nClassification of each recipe into ingredients, description, …\n\nThe division of the task into smaller tasks allows us to use less complex methods. In this notebook we focus on the task #1.\n\n\nNowadays, one straightforward solution is to run an LLM on the OCR output and ask it to cluster the text. You can even set up a complete workflow: cluster the text, check it, extract ingredients and instructions and the check again to ensure all content is used recipes are not mixed up.\nThe downside about all this? It is expensive to run. Especially if we introduce correctness checks. How much more expensive?\nFor reference, Google currently charges $1.5 per 1000 pages, whereas as Mistral asks for $3 per 1000 pages for annotated output. Google’s new interface, which (like Mistral) relies on Vision Transformers also charges asks for $1.5 per 1000 pages. Layout parsing costs extra at $10 per 1000 pages.\nLet’s say each of your users has about 2000 books he wants to convert. That results to $23 per user; and that is without classification. A custom extractor sets you back another $20. So the full workflow is about $50 per user. Again only for recipe extraction. Interaction with the recipe database will probably cost around $3 per month.\n\n\n\nI recently tested Docling, a transformer-based architecture. It has created quite a buzz recently.\nHere is my short evaluation. On the document which we are going to use throughout this notebook, it failed. The deterministic demo (temperature=0) got stuck in an inference loop. I tried increasing temperature and add other tweaks to help the model escape local optima. This came at the cost of accuracy.\nThe model repeated titles as ingredients for other recipes and failed to stop properly.\n\n\n\nDocling Result: one recipe title is not detected as such\n\n\nThe model has issue with line breaks: “Die Pilze damit bin-den” became “Pilze damit ben den” including line breaks.\nOn top of that, the speed was poor on a legacy GPU (GTX 1080), despite running at full load for the full time of 22 seconds!

The issue: there is no text in any of those blocks. Most of the blocks span multiple lines, which means our font-size approach does not work. We do not know how many lines or words exist.\nThis is where DocLayout-YOLO falls short. We could run every single block through OCR. On a local OCR program that could be as effective as full page detection, maybe even better. But since we rely on Google OCR, that approach would lead to very high cost, as billing is per request.\nInstead, we align the two boxes and copy every OCR word which falls in a Doclayout boxes to the related dataframe row.\n\ndf_titles_yolo = df_yolo[df_yolo[\"is_title\"]].copy()\ndf_titles_yolo[\"text\"] = \"\"\ndf_titles_yolo[\"average_word_height_sum\"] = 0\ndf_titles_yolo[\"word_count\"] = 0\n\n\nfor block in page:\n    for para_idx, para in enumerate(block.get(\"paragraphs\", [])):\n\n        for word_idx, word in enumerate(para.get(\"words\", [])):\n            symbols = [s[\"text\"] for s in word.get(\"symbols\", [])]\n            word_text = \"\".join(symbols)\n            word_verts = word[\"boundingBox\"][\"vertices\"]\n            wx1, wy1 = word_verts[0].get(\"x\", 0), word_verts[0].get(\"y\", 0)\n            wx2, wy2 = word_verts[3].get(\"x\", 0), word_verts[3].get(\"y\", 0)\n            wcx = (wx1 + wx2) / 2\n            wcy = (wy1 + wy2) / 2\n            word_height = abs(wy2 - wy1)\n\n            # assign to title box if inside\n            for idx, row in df_titles_yolo.iterrows():\n                if (row[\"x1\"] &lt;= wcx &lt;= row[\"x2\"]) and (row[\"y1\"] &lt;= wcy &lt;= row[\"y2\"]):\n                    # append word text\n                    df_titles_yolo.at[idx, \"text\"] += \" \" + word_text\n                    # accumulate height + count\n                    df_titles_yolo.at[idx, \"average_word_height_sum\"] += word_height\n                    df_titles_yolo.at[idx, \"word_count\"] += 1\n                    # can only be in one title\n                    break\n\n\ndf_titles_yolo[\"font_size\"] = df_titles_yolo.average_word_height_sum / df_titles_yolo.word_count\ndf_titles_yolo[[\"text\",\"is_title\",\"font_size\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntext\nis_title\nfont_size\n\n\n\n\n0\nSoupe à l'ail bonne femme\nTrue\n56.600000\n\n\n3\nCroûtes aux champignons\nTrue\n47.333333\n\n\n18\nSpeiseöl Parmesankäse\nTrue\n29.500000\n\n\n19\n\nTrue\nNaN\n\n\n20\nGigot de chevreuil\nTrue\n62.000000\n\n\n26\nRehblatt\nTrue\n37.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs indicated earlier, we have different kind of false positives.

    "text": "4 Recipe detection using only OCR\nNow with the titles cleaned, we know the number of titles. Next step is the distribution of the rows of each dataframe to the recipes.\nAn important domain knowledge, or prior knowledge, is that almost all recipe formats are organized in columns. Titles are usually placed somewhere in these columns, and a title marks the beginning of a recipe.\nThe main drawback: any other layout format cannot be processed.\nWe will do this approach in two steps:\n\nSplit the text into columns based on the row’s bounding box\nSplit columns into recipes based on title position.\n\n\n4.1 Working on OCR Block level\nThis was actually the hardest part. For the sake of brevity I only provide the final result and not the full way.\n\n4.1.1 Column detection\nThe OCR pipeline has already discovered fragments of text that belong together, and organized them into paragraphs and blocks.\nOur algorithm works with two approaches.\n\nWe assume there are no more than five columns, and they are evenly distributed. When column size is unequal, that is usually the case if ingredients are in a column.\n\nWe search for the best fit.

    "text": "2 Searching for something better\nThere is one thing I particularly like about GitHub. Usually somebody else already solved your problem. You only need to get your head around his solution and then improve from there.\nThere is a custom C++ street view client. https://github.com/TheGreatRambler/streetview_client/\nThis application loads the full street view panoramas and then uses a custom stitching algorithm. This algorithm avoids the transition. By preloading an entire route, you can easily avoid any download lag. This seemed to solve my troubles with street view.\nThen I had the idea. What if street view would be like a computer game? Why press the mouse button to turn and look around? In a game, you usually just move the mouse and use WASD to move around."

    "text": "3 The first street view game: custom rendering\n\n3.1 Rapid street view viewing\n\n\n\nThe first version\n\n\nAfter spending a few evenings changing the code, I came up with my first street view based game. And it was true, the speed was amazing. You can see an animation here:\n\n\n\nExploration in the waterpocket fold, Utah.\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Usability and legality are important for a product\nWhen turning an idea into a prototype, there is always the question of where to stop. How far should you continue and when should you share the solution with others? Personally, if I am sharing code, I try to maintain a minimal quality standard.\nI decided against publicly sharing the code for this version because of some drawbacks.\n\n3.2.1 Usability issues\nThe program requires the full download of the panorama, which can be 25MB. If you advance too quickly, the panorama hasn’t loaded yet. Google uses a very intelligent method to avoid this lag by only loading parts of the panorama that are visible. In the Google Street view, this effect is visible when quickly turning around.\nPreloading everything in a radius solves this. A function that already exists in the GitHub version of the streeview_client. While it is working, it is not very practical. As already said, the high res street view panoramas are 25MB. In dense city areas, there are many panoramas, close to each other. If free exploration were to be possible, a lot of data needs to be loaded. Even loading all the panoramas along a predefined route takes a lot of time. The size of your temp directory quickly explodes. In addition, it works only with a quick internet connection.\nStreet view animation works by linking one panorama to the next. Sometimes a panorama hits a dead end, even if the street continues and, in a few hundred meters, another panorama exists.\nGoogle maps solve this dead-end situation by requiring the user to just repositioning the peg man. In a custom engine, the only option would be to advance in the general direction and take the next panorama in that direction. Or reimplement the peg man map.\n\n\n3.2.2 Legal issues\nIf you want to show street view data, you have to do it in a way that Google details in their documentation. And the custom render from the great rambler is probably not part of this."

    "text": "4 Second Version: using the Google Maps API\n\n4.1 Innovative use of the google api to reduce transition effect\nAs mentioned before, the main reason for not releasing the previous version publicly is that it risks violating the Google Maps’ API’s terms of service. Loading multiple panoramas on the same page seems to be allowed. As I detail below, you will just pay more for this.\nThe transition and loading problem is solved by using multiple panorama renderers. Basically you are looking at three panoramas. Depending on your internet connection, you can increase the or decrease the pause between the panoramas. If the loading pause becomes too small, the original transition effect becomes visible.\n\n\n4.2 Travelling around\nThe current version solves the issues with the usability of street view by extending its functionality with the mouse turning, auto rotating, and auto forward. We always transition in the direction of view. If there are no further panoramas to the side, you can even look through the side window while advancing forward.\nIn google Street view you have to look at every panorama, which gets cumbersome on a highway. I use a jump distance to jump over some panoramas. Together with the reload frequency, this defines the speed of the “virtual vehicle”.\nThis leads me to one of the coolest use cases, besides exploring unknown areas. Traveling on scenic highways.\n."

It is just too costly to run it otherwise. Using multiple panoramas, you need to pay for every panorama you instantiate. Together with the lookup of the position, this puts the use at almost 3 cent per page load in 2024.\nAdvertisement generates revenue of 1c per page load for a well-working website. A mobile game rarely costs more than €5. All of these results in a loss for the app."

    "text": "2 Music, just another form of Data\nBefore we dive into the tools, let’s first clarify what our data looks like. In the following, we look at metadata, audio and embeddings.\n\n2.1 Theme metadata\nTo help the tool generate better playlists, I divided the day into two distinct segments: a calm part and a more energetic, danceable part. We’ll store this information as metadata and revisit it later in our analysis.\nWe note which song is in which sublist, as we will require this later.\n\n\nCode\nimport csv\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\ndef create_manifest():\n    with open(\"/app/data/raw-previews/explainabletrack_manifest.csv\", \"w\", newline='') as f:\n        writer = csv.writer(f)\n        writer.writerow([\"filename\", \"theme\"])\n\n        for theme_dir in Path(\"/app/data/raw-previews/separate\").iterdir():\n            if theme_dir.is_dir():\n                theme = theme_dir.name\n                for audio_file in theme_dir.glob(\"*.mp3\"):\n                    writer.writerow([audio_file.name, theme])\n\n\n\ncreate_manifest()\n\nWe now have a table with data, also called tabular data. Your music provider has much bigger tables with a lot more columns (genre, speed, mood, …). For simplicity, we restrict ourselves. Let’s look at the data.\n\nmanifest = pd.read_csv(\"/app/data/raw-previews/explainabletrack_manifest.csv\")\nmanifest.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfilename\ntheme\n\n\n\n\n0\nWith Or Without You - U2.mp3\nruhig\n\n\n1\nLa javanaise - Serge Gainsbourg.mp3\nruhig\n\n\n2\nDjadja - Aya Nakamura.mp3\nruhig\n\n\n3\nLe chant des sirènes - Fréro Delavega.mp3\nruhig\n\n\n4\nstart.mp3\nruhig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd recheck the count in the two categories.\n\nmanifest.theme.value_counts()\n\ntheme\nparty    129\nruhig    116\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePaths in this notebook\n\n\n\n\n\nI use a dockerized version of Deej-Ai, which can be found on my GitHub. Therefore, paths are inside the docker, this is why paths sometimes start with /app and sometimes with /opt.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Audio data\nWe are going to study sound signals. Sound is usually analyzed with the help of a spectrogram. While a lot more complex models exist, spectrogram can be just processed as images. This allows us to a simple classification analysis with something as simple as Resnet model.\nThe following picture shows a spectrogram. On the x-axis is the time. The y-axis shows the frequencies. The color is the amplitude of the wave form at this frequency and time.\n\n\nCode\nimport librosa\nimport librosa.display\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load audio\nfilename = '/app/data/raw-previews/combined/Purple Rain - Prince.mp3'\ny, sr = librosa.load(filename, sr=22050)\n\n# Create log-Mel spectrogram, this converts the waveform into a picture\nn_fft = 2048\nhop_length = 512\nn_mels = 96\n\nS = librosa.feature.melspectrogram(y=y, sr=sr, n_fft=n_fft,\n                                   hop_length=hop_length, n_mels=n_mels)\nlog_S = librosa.power_to_db(S, ref=np.max)\n\n# normalize the spectogram for further processing\nlog_S = (log_S - np.min(log_S)) / (np.max(log_S) - np.min(log_S))\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))\nlibrosa.display.specshow(log_S, sr=sr, hop_length=hop_length,\n                         x_axis='time', y_axis='mel')\nplt.colorbar(format='%+2.0f dB')\nplt.title(\"Log-Mel Spectrogram\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Slicing images\nWe use spectrogram images to classify the songs. The procedure is identical to your favourite bear or chesse classifier. However, classifying the full spectrogram of one song as a whole is often not very helpful. The songs are usually defined by local features. We either need a more complex model than a CNN, or we reduce the data the CNN sees. In practice, the latter option means we are going to slice the image.\nFor the study, we use spotify track previews. They usually provide a good sample of the track itself. A more comprehensive analysis would study the whole track and respect intra-track variation.\nLet’s slice a track.\n\ndef slice_image(slice_size=216, stride=216):\n    slices = []\n    starts_sec = []\n    for start in range(0, log_S.shape[1] - slice_size + 1, stride):\n        end = start + slice_size\n        slices.append(log_S[:, start:end])\n        start_sec = start * hop_length / sr\n        end_sec = end * hop_length / sr\n        starts_sec.append((start_sec, end_sec))\n    return slices, starts_sec\n\nslices, starts_sec = slice_image()\nprint(\"Number of slices\", len(slices))\n\nNumber of slices 5\n\n\nLet’s create a side-by-side view of full spectrogram and slices\n\n\nCode\nnum_slices_to_show = 3\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(12, 6), gridspec_kw={'height_ratios': [2, 1]}, sharex=True)\n\n## Plot full spectrogram\nlibrosa.display.specshow(log_S, sr=sr, hop_length=hop_length,\n                         x_axis='time', y_axis='mel', ax=axs[0])\naxs[0].set_title(\"Full Log-Mel Spectrogram\")\naxs[0].set_ylabel(\"Mel bin\")\n\n# Overlay slices\nfor i in range(min(num_slices_to_show, len(slices))):\n    start, end = starts_sec[i]\n    axs[0].axvspan(start, end, edgecolor='red', facecolor='none', lw=2, linestyle='--')\n\n# Slice image\n## Slices stitched together horizontally, padded to full time width\nslice_canvas = np.zeros_like(log_S) * np.nan  # fill with NaNs\n\nfor i in range(min(num_slices_to_show, len(slices))):\n    start_frame = int(starts_sec[i][0] * sr / hop_length)\n    slice_data = slices[i]\n    slice_canvas[:, start_frame:start_frame + slice_data.shape[1]] = slice_data\n\nlibrosa.display.specshow(slice_canvas, sr=sr, hop_length=hop_length,\n                         x_axis='time', y_axis='mel', ax=axs[1])\n\nfor i in range(min(num_slices_to_show, len(slices))):\n    start, end = starts_sec[i]\n    axs[1].axvspan(start, end, edgecolor='red', facecolor='none', lw=2, linestyle='--')\n\naxs[1].set_title(f\"{num_slices_to_show} Aligned Slices (padded to full duration)\")\naxs[1].set_ylabel(\"Mel bin\")\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s define a function for slicing which we will be using later.\n\ndef mp3_to_slices(path):\n    N_MELS = 96\n    SLICE_SIZE = 216  # must match model input\n    y, sr = librosa.load(path, sr=22050)\n    S = librosa.feature.melspectrogram(y=y, sr=22050, n_fft=2048,\n                                       hop_length=512, n_mels=N_MELS, fmax=sr / 2)\n    x = np.ndarray(shape=(S.shape[1] // SLICE_SIZE, N_MELS, SLICE_SIZE, 1), dtype=float)\n\n    # we use the original code to get the same input batch size\n    for slice in range(S.shape[1] // SLICE_SIZE):\n        log_S = librosa.power_to_db(S[:, slice * SLICE_SIZE: (slice + 1) * SLICE_SIZE], ref=np.max)\n        if np.max(log_S) - np.min(log_S) != 0:\n            log_S = (log_S - np.min(log_S)) / (np.max(log_S) - np.min(log_S))\n        x[slice, :, :, 0] = log_S\n\n    return x\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Embeddings\nInstead of working with the spectrogram images in the model, the author of Deej-AI has done something a little bit more complex. He was not interested in knowing which song sounds similar to another, but which songs are usually played together. From this knowledge, he inferred that similar sounding new songs could be also played together with songs in the database.\nThe understanding of song lyrics and context is implicit in the playlists.\nHe therefore first encoded many playlists and then matched the spectrograms against this in another training.\nThe complete Training Inference Pipeline can be visualized like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\nformat:\n  html:\n    mermaid:\n      theme: neutral\n---\nflowchart TB\n  %% === Training #1: Track2Vec ===\n  subgraph T1[Training #1: Track2Vec]\n    A1[Audio Files] --&gt; |Organize| B1[Playlists]\n    B1 --&gt; |Train Track2Vec| C[100D Embeddings]\n  end\n\n\n  %% === Training #2: Mp3ToVec ===\n  subgraph T2[Training #2: Mp3ToVec]\n    D1[Audio Files] --&gt;|Convert & Slice| E1[Log-Mel Spectrograms]\n    C --&gt; |Use| F1[Embeddings as Labels]\n    E1 --&gt;  E2[Training Input]\n    F1 --&gt;  E2[Training Input]\n    E2 --&gt; |Train with Cosine Similarity Loss| G1[CNN with 100D Output]\n  end\n\n  %% === Inference ===\n  subgraph INF[Inference]\n    I1[Audio Files] --&gt; |Convert & Slice| I2[Log-Mel Spectrograms]\n    G1 --&gt; |Use| I3[Inference Model]\n    I2 --&gt; I4[Inference Input]\n    I3 --&gt; I4[Inference Input]\n    I4 --&gt; |run model| I5[100D Embeddings]\n    I6[Query Idx] --&gt; |Cosine Similarity to Find Similar Songs To Query| I7[Best Next Song]\n    I5 --&gt; I6\n  end\n\n    subgraph t[Training]\n        T1\n        T2\n\n    end\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using strings as Labels, the embeddings from the Spotify playlist-based Training act as such. Therefore, it is better to speak of dependent variable \\(y\\). Our labels have the dimension of 100. The second network is a standard classification.\nDuring inference, the predicted output for every spectrogram is a 100D vector. The spectrogram acts as features \\(X_{inf}\\). In a final step, we rank songs by the best fit to our query.\nTo answer our questions “Why was song A chosen?” we only need to analyze the inference related to training #2.\nWe already had a look at \\(X\\). Now let’s look at the dependent variable \\(y\\)."

    "text": "3 T-SNE for high dimensionality data.\nWe are interested in visualizing our labels. I ran the embedding creation in Deej-Ai with MP3ToVec. This is done via model.predict(x). Where \\(x\\) are the slices we defined earlier. The data was then stored.\n\nimport pickle\n\nfilenames = ['/opt/project/data/raw-previews/combined/' + f for f in manifest['filename']]\n\nwith open(\"/app/data/pickles/combined/mp3tovecs/mp3tovec.p\", \"rb\") as f:\n    mp3tovecs = pickle.load(f)\n\nX = np.vstack([mp3tovecs[f] for f in filenames if f in mp3tovecs])\n\nThe issue, the data is of the form 100D for each file. How to visualize this. A straightforward approach would be a matrix plot.\n\n\nCode\nplt.figure(figsize=(5, 10))\nplt.imshow(X, cmap='viridis')\nplt.colorbar()\nplt.title(\"Embedded Vectors Visualization\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Song Index\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Embedded Vector\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this we can actually not see much. Only that many dimensions are characteristic in their value (vertical lines)\nWe need to reduce the dimensions to plot this data in a scatter plot. T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (TNSE) is a popular dimensionality reduction technique. You can read more on wikipedia. But as with any complex method, there are some caveats. A nice article about the limitations is in distill.pub.\n\n3.1 T-SNE Limitations TL;DR;\n\nDistances are not reliable: Global structure is often distorted; distances between clusters are meaningless.\nCluster sizes are misleading: Size/shape doesn’t reflect actual data density or variance.\nClusters can be artifacts: t-SNE can create apparent groupings even from random data.\nSensitive to hyperparameters: Perplexity, learning rate, and iterations drastically affect results.\nNon-deterministic: Results vary with different random seeds; always run multiple times.\nNo generalization: Can’t project new data without retraining (non-parametric).\nSlow on large datasets: Scales poorly; approximations or UMAP may be better.\n\n\n\n3.2 T-SNE Best Practice TL;DR;\n\nTune parameters carefully.\nRun multiple times to check stability.\nDon’t trust distances, cluster sizes, or shapes.\nUse it for exploration, not clustering or quantification.\nCompare with PCA, UMAP, or other embeddings.\n\nIn short, the main issue is the sensitive to the hyperparameters. A recent paper, Gove et al. 2022, came up with a comprehensive study. In contrast to a previous study Kobak and Berens, 2019, the authors found no dependence on the size of the dataset (previously 1% of dataset size). The previous results translate to perplexity of 2.5. This means any point is just influenced by 2 other points. This often overstressed the local structure. Instead, we focus on the newer magic recipe.\n\n\n3.3 The magic recipe\nHere is a summary of the findings:\nBegin with\nperplexity = 16\nlearning_rate = 10\nexaggeration = 1\niters = 1000 # Above 1000 iters low variation\nThen tune by visual inspection\n\nBlobs? → raise exaggeration to 3–4.\nLost global shape? → double learning-rate or bump perplexity (never past 16).\nOver-compressed? → lower exaggeration or learning-rate.\n\nBig data (≫20 k points): try perplexity ≈ n/100 and lr ≈ n/12.\n\n\n3.4 T-SNE for the playlist data\nLet’s apply these findings to our data. To check the stability of the result, we treat this as a convergence issue and write a function that checks the solution for stability.\n\nfrom sklearn.manifold import TSNE\n\n\ndef tsne_until_converged(\n        X,\n        step_iter=250,\n        max_iter=10000,\n        tol=1e-3,\n        random_state=42,\n        verbose=True,\n        perplexity=5,\n        learning_rate=10,\n        exaggeration=1\n):\n    n = X.shape[0]\n\n    common = dict(\n        n_components=2,\n        perplexity=perplexity,\n        learning_rate=learning_rate,\n        early_exaggeration=exaggeration,\n        init=\"pca\",\n        random_state=random_state,\n        verbose=False,\n    )\n\n    # we always start at 250\n    total_iter = 250\n    tsne = TSNE(max_iter=total_iter, **common)\n    Y = tsne.fit_transform(X)\n\n    history = []\n    prev = Y.copy()\n\n    while total_iter &lt; max_iter:\n        total_iter += step_iter\n        tsne = TSNE(\n            max_iter=total_iter,\n            **common,\n        )\n        Y = tsne.fit_transform(X)\n\n        # Check the stability\n        delta = np.linalg.norm(Y - prev, axis=1).mean()\n        history.append(delta)\n        if verbose:\n            print(f\"[{total_iter + step_iter} iters] mean move = {delta:.6f}\")\n\n        if delta &lt; tol:\n            if verbose:\n                print(\"✓ Converged\")\n            break\n\n        prev = Y.copy()\n\n    return Y, history, total_iter\n\nHere are my iterations, which I did follow the magic recipe.\n\n%%capture\nembedding1, movement1, max_iter1 = tsne_until_converged(X)\n\n\n%%capture\nembedding2, movement2, max_iter2 = tsne_until_converged(X, perplexity=10)\n\n\n%%capture\nembedding3, movement3, max_iter3 = tsne_until_converged(X, perplexity=16)\n\n\n%%capture\nembedding4, movement4, max_iter4 = tsne_until_converged(X, perplexity=16, exaggeration=4)\n\n\n%%capture\nembedding5, movement5, max_iter5 = tsne_until_converged(X, perplexity=16, exaggeration=4, learning_rate=40)\n\nLet’s plot the 2D data and the stability of the embeddings.\n\n\nCode\n# for plotting we define a helper function\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\ndef plot_tsne_results(\n        results,\n        filenames=None,\n        titles=None,\n        palette=\"Set2\",\n        figsize=(6, 12),\n):\n    n = len(results)\n    fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=n, ncols=2, figsize=(figsize[0] * n, figsize[1] * 2))\n\n    for i, (embedding, movement) in enumerate(results):\n        # 1.

There are three distinctive groups in all pictures. The standard setting in run2 leads to vertically squeezed distribution. The result in this respect seems better in run 5, with early exaggeration and increased learning rate.\n\n\n3.5 Can we see two groups (party and quite) in the data?\nAs mentioned earlier, I was not entirely happy with the matches. As a result, triaged the files into two groups. One which I experienced as quiet. Let’s see if we can confirm this very subjective impression in the data, even though we never told the model that these two groups exist.\nWe define the data to be plotted to include theme and filename.\n\n\nCode\n# Load manifest again\nmanifest = pd.read_csv(\"/app/data/raw-previews/explainabletrack_manifest.csv\")\nlabels = [f for f in manifest['theme']]\ntsne_df = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"x\": embedding5[:, 0],\n    \"y\": embedding5[:, 1],\n    \"theme\": labels,\n    \"filename\": filenames\n})\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsns.scatterplot(\n    data=tsne_df,\n    x='x', y='y',\n    hue='theme',\n    palette='Set2',\n    s=60, edgecolor='k', alpha=0.7\n)\n\nplt.title(\"t-SNE Projection Colored by Manual Theme Label\", fontsize=14)\nplt.xlabel(\"TSNE-1\");\nplt.ylabel(\"TSNE-2\")\nplt.legend(title=\"Theme\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the data does not fit the perceived feature of “quietness.” The only think that is noticeable in the picture is a clustering of green points to the left and the bottom of the patch 2 and 3, respectively.\n\n3.5.1 Intra- and inter-theme similarity\nWe can express this in numbers and calculate intra- and inter-theme similarity. The themes should be distinct and have little variation.\n\n\nCode\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_distances\nimport itertools\n\ntheme_to_indices = tsne_df.groupby(\"theme\").groups\ntheme_names = list(theme_to_indices.keys())\n\nsimilarity_stats = []\n\nfor t1, t2 in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(theme_names, 2):\n    i1 = list(theme_to_indices[t1])\n    i2 = list(theme_to_indices[t2])\n\n    vec1 = X[i1]\n    vec2 = X[i2]\n\n    distances = cosine_distances(vec1, vec2)\n    mean_distance = distances.mean()\n\n    similarity_stats.append({\n        \"theme_1\": t1,\n        \"theme_2\": t2,\n        \"mean_cosine_distance\": mean_distance\n    })\n\nsimilarity_df = pd.DataFrame(similarity_stats)\nsimilarity_df.sort_values(by=\"mean_cosine_distance\", inplace=True)\nsimilarity_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntheme_1\ntheme_2\nmean_cosine_distance\n\n\n\n\n0\nparty\nparty\n0.040207\n\n\n2\nruhig\nruhig\n0.046004\n\n\n1\nparty\nruhig\n0.048002\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfrom sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score\n\nscore = silhouette_score(X, labels, metric='cosine')\nprint(f\"Silhouette Score (cosine): {score:.3f}\")\n\n\nSilhouette Score (cosine): 0.085\n\n\nAll of these numbers are very close to zero. This data backs the visual impression: The manual groups have nothing to do with the automatic selection. This explains why I was not satisfied. Features that I deemed important are somehow not in the data. Interesting.\n\n\n\n3.6 Similarity analysis of single songs\nLet’s study more how the model behaves with respect to a query. Our query song is Purple Rain - Prince.\nMy final playlist had this ordering\n\nLuna - Bombay Bicycle Club.mp3\nPurple Rain - Prince.mp3\nEverybody Wants To Rule The World - Tears For Fears.mp3\nKiss from a Rose - Seal.mp3\n\nWe first define some helpers\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n\ndef get_vector_by_name(db, search_term):\n    return db[\"/opt/project/data/raw-previews/combined/\" + search_term + \".mp3\"]\n\n\ndef compare_songs(song_A, song_B, db):\n    song_A_vec = get_vector_by_name(db, song_A)\n    song_B_vec = get_vector_by_name(db, song_B)\n\n    sim = cosine_similarity(song_A_vec.reshape(1, -1), song_B_vec.reshape(1, -1))[0][0]\n    print(f\"Similarity to {song_A}: {sim:.3f}\")\n\n\ndef most_similar_song(song_A_vec, vectors, filenames):\n    sims = cosine_similarity(song_A_vec.reshape(1, -1), vectors)[0]\n    min_idx = np.argmin(sims)\n    min_score = sims[min_idx]\n\n    print(f\"Weakest match cosine similarity: {min_score:.3f}\")\n    sorted_indices = np.argsort(sims)[::-1]  # Descending order\n\n    second_idx = sorted_indices[1]\n\n    return filenames[second_idx], sims[second_idx]\n\nLet’s see what is the best fitting song to Purple Rain.\n\nbest_match, score = most_similar_song(get_vector_by_name(mp3tovecs, \"Purple Rain - Prince\"), X, filenames)\nprint(f\"Best match: {best_match} — cosine sim: {score:.3f}\")\n\nWeakest match cosine similarity: 0.825\nBest match: /opt/project/data/raw-previews/combined/Mesmerise - Temples.mp3 — cosine sim: 0.999\n\n\nAgain, we confirm that the automatic matching produced something different from my selection. Let’s compare all songs and also one which is completely off.\n\ncompare_songs(\"Purple Rain - Prince\", \"Everybody Wants To Rule The World - Tears For Fears\", mp3tovecs)\n\nSimilarity to Purple Rain - Prince: 0.998\n\n\n\ncompare_songs(\"Purple Rain - Prince\", \"Luna - Bombay Bicycle Club\", mp3tovecs)\n\nSimilarity to Purple Rain - Prince: 0.995\n\n\n\ncompare_songs(\"Purple Rain - Prince\", \"Mr. Brightside - The Killers\", mp3tovecs)\n\nSimilarity to Purple Rain - Prince: 0.933\n\n\n\ncompare_songs(\"Purple Rain - Prince\", \"Kiss from a Rose - Seal\", mp3tovecs)\n\nSimilarity to Purple Rain - Prince: 0.990\n\n\n\n3.6.1 Plotting single songs in TSNE plot\nAs a final step, we want to visualize what we have just expressed in numbers. How are the songs related to the plot?\n\n\nCode\nlabels = [\"none\"] * len(filenames)\n\nsongs = [\"Purple Rain - Prince\", \"Mesmerise - Temples\", \"Everybody Wants To Rule The World - Tears For Fears\",\n         \"Mr. Brightside - The Killers\", ]\n\nfor i, f in enumerate(filenames):\n    for song in songs:\n        if song in f:\n            labels[i] = song\n            break\n\ntsne_df = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"x\": embedding5[:, 0],\n    \"y\": embedding5[:, 1],\n    \"theme\": labels,\n    \"filename\": filenames\n})\n\n\n\n\nCode\npalette = {\n    \"none\": \"#bbbbbb\",\n    songs[1]: \"black\",\n    songs[0]: \"green\",\n    songs[2]: \"orange\",\n    songs[3]: \"red\",\n\n}\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.scatterplot(\n    data=tsne_df,\n    x=\"x\", y=\"y\",\n    hue=\"theme\", hue_order=[\"none\", songs[1], songs[0], songs[2], songs[3]],\n    palette=palette,\n    s=60, edgecolor=\"k\", alpha=0.7\n)\nplt.legend(title=\"Label\", loc=\"best\")\nplt.title(\"t-SNE with three highlighted songs\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe picture confirms it again. Temples - Mesmerise is the best match. It should have been picked. It appears The nearby match Everybody Wants To Rule The World - Tears For Fears was not the closest match and only got taken because I interfered with the playlist creation."

In the next section, we will look at Integrated Gradients, which observes down to pixel level.

This results in a coarse heatmap; red blobs where the CNN focused, and blank areas elsewhere.\nIn terms of interpretability, this allows a visual inspection, which goes beyond simple scores.\n\n\n4.2 Implementation\n\n\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import load_model\nimport tensorflow as tf\nmodel = load_model(\n    '/app/speccy_model',\n    custom_objects={\n        'cosine_proximity':\n            tf.compat.v1.keras.losses.cosine_proximity\n    })\nmodel.trainable = False;\nconv_layer = model.get_layer(\"separable_conv2d_3\")\n\n\nfrom scipy.ndimage import gaussian_filter\n\n\ndef score_fn(emb):\n    emb = tf.nn.l2_normalize(emb, axis=1)\n    return tf.tensordot(emb, vec_A, axes=1)\n    \ndef grad_cam(slice_tensor,\n             model, conv_layer, score_fn,\n             eps=1e-8):\n    # build a model that gives conv feature-maps and final embedding\n    grad_model = tf.keras.Model(\n        inputs=model.inputs,\n        outputs=[conv_layer.output, model.output]\n    )\n\n    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:\n        conv_out, preds = grad_model(slice_tensor)\n        tape.watch(conv_out)\n        score = score_fn(preds)\n\n    \n    grads = tape.gradient(score, conv_out) \n    weights = tf.reduce_mean(grads, axis=[1, 2])\n\n    cam = tf.reduce_sum(weights[:, None, None, :] * conv_out, axis=-1)[0] \n    cam = tf.nn.relu(cam)\n\n    cam = tf.image.resize(cam[..., None], slice_tensor.shape[1:3])[..., 0]\n    cam = (cam - tf.reduce_min(cam)) / (tf.reduce_max(cam) - tf.reduce_min(cam) + eps)\n    return cam.numpy()\n\n\ndef full_song_grad_cam(model, query_slices, vec_A, conv_layer,\n                       n_mels=96, slice_size=216, sigma=1.5):\n    \n    vec_A_tf = tf.constant(vec_A / np.linalg.norm(vec_A), tf.float32)\n\n    def score_fn(embedding):\n        return tf.tensordot(tf.nn.l2_normalize(embedding, axis=1), vec_A_tf, axes=1)\n        \n    gc_full = np.zeros((n_mels, query_slices.shape[0] * slice_size))\n\n    for i, slice_tensor in enumerate(query_slices):\n        slice_tensor = slice_tensor[None, ...]\n        gc = grad_cam(slice_tensor, model, conv_layer, score_fn)\n        gc = gaussian_filter(gc, sigma=sigma)\n        gc_full[:, i * slice_size: (i + 1) * slice_size] = gc\n        \n    return gc_full\n\nNow that we have defined a function to do GRAD-CAM for the full song. Let’s study the difference for song A and song B. We will get an answer which regions where more important to which song and which were identically important.\n\nvec_A = mp3tovecs['/opt/project/data/raw-previews/combined/Mesmerise - Temples.mp3']\nvec_B = mp3tovecs['/opt/project/data/raw-previews/combined/Everybody Wants To Rule The World - Tears For Fears.mp3']\nx_query = mp3_to_slices('/app/data/raw-previews/combined/Purple Rain - Prince.mp3')\n\n\ncam_A = full_song_grad_cam(model, x_query, vec_A, conv_layer)\ncam_B = full_song_grad_cam(model, x_query, vec_B, conv_layer)\n\n# we use signed log, as the songs are very close together.\ndiff = tf.math.log((cam_A + 1e-5) / (cam_B + 1e-5))\ndiff_clipped = tf.clip_by_value(diff, -3.0, 3.0)\n\n\n\nCode\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 3))\n\nplt.imshow(diff_clipped, cmap=\"berlin\", alpha=0.6, origin=\"lower\", aspect=\"auto\")\nplt.colorbar(label=\"Grad-CAM intensity\")\nplt.title(\"Where the CNN ‘looked’ to match Song A\")\nplt.tight_layout();\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to the clipping, the graph is easy to read. The Song had a lot more information, which made it similar to the query song.\nOnly at the very end are some blue spots. This could indicate that the spotify preview covers only the less relevant sections of the entire song for the particular comparison. Whereas I was listening to the full song. Song B seems better for the rhythm as the blue patches repeat.\nWe will dive deeper into this in the next section."

    "text": "5 Integrated gradients\nWhy did the model prefer Song A over Song B? We know that the model turns spectrograms into 100-D vectors and ranks candidates using cosine similarity. That alone doesn’t tell us why one track got a higher score than another. To dig deeper, we use Integrated Gradients (IG). This method helps identify which parts of a spectrogram contribute most to the similarity score, that is which pixels or frequencies increase the score.\nIn contrast to Grad-Cam, we do not look at the feature level, but on input level through the entire network.\n\n5.1 Background\nIG works by comparing the actual input (the spectrogram) to a baseline input, typically silence.\nWe then gradually transition from the baseline to the real input by scaling the spectrogram with a factor \\(\\alpha\\).\n\\[ x_α = baseline + \\alpha × (input - baseline) \\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha ∈ [0,1]\\)\nAt each step, we compute the gradient of the output with respect to the input. When we average across all steps, we get the average contribution of each pixel.\nIn Pytorch we have the Captum library to directly do this. However, Deej-AI works on an older keras 2.13. We need to implement Integrated Gradients from scratch.\n\n\n5.2 From scratch development of integrated gradients\n\n5.2.1 Method for one slice\nWe define the integrated gradients for one slice\nLet’s first clarify what we expect from the model\nLuckily for a linear model \\[f(x) = w^\\top x + b\\]\nthe Integrated Gradients have the closed-form\n\\[\\mathrm{IG}(x) \\;=\\; (x - x_0)\\,\\odot\\,w\\]\nWe intend to use integrated gradients to check the impact on the cosine similarity score.

Much of which has been the development of the integrated gradients.\nWhat we were originally interested in is the question of why Song A was chosen over Song B for a query Song.\nFor this to work, we now need to take our real model, the one that produced the 100D embeddings.\nAs well as three songs.\n\nFor us this is Purple Rain for the query.\nMesmerise for Song A,\nand Everybody wants to rule the world for Song B.\n\nSong A and Song B are very close together. While experimenting, I found that using the gradients is challenging in this case.\nThere are two ways we can calculate contrastive IG.\nThe standard way: subtract IG\n\\[\n\\mathrm{IG}_A(x) = (x - x') \\odot \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{k=1}^m \\nabla_x F_A\\left(x' + \\frac{k}{m}(x - x')\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathrm{IG}_B(x) = (x - x') \\odot \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{k=1}^m \\nabla_x F_B\\left(x' + \\frac{k}{m}(x - x')\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ContrastIG}(x) = \\mathrm{IG}_A(x) - \\mathrm{IG}_B(x)\n\\]\nand method 2 that can be helpful if the embeddings are very close. The reason is that first taking the gradient and then calculating the difference amplifies the noise. This method has been introduced by Sundararajan et al. 2017.\nThe second method uses one scoring function, as described in the Captum interpretability library and aligned with contrastive explanation principles from Dhurandhar et al. 2018.\n\\[\nF(x) = \\text{sim}(x, A) - \\text{sim}(x, B)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathrm{ContrastIG}(x) = (x - x') \\odot \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{k=1}^m \\nabla_x \\left[ F\\left(x' + \\frac{k}{m}(x - x')\\right) \\right]\n\\]\nWe will try both.\n\n5.3.1 Getting the data ready\nWe need\n\nload our model: the one that produces the vectors.\nthe spectrogram of the query song.

We can rerun the analysis with smoothing per slice.\n\n\nCode\nfull_ig_method_1_smoothed = full_song_contrastive_ig_method1(\n    model,\n    query_slices=query_slices,\n    vec_A=vec_A,\n    vec_B=vec_B,\n    score_fn=cosine_score_fn,\n    sigma=2.0\n)\nplot_ig_to_bins(full_ig_method_1_smoothed)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smoothing made the graphs easier to read. Attribution is very low. Song B is better in the low frequencies. Whereas a song A is better in the high frequencies. The graphs look nice, but there is a catch… Let’s look at method2 first.\n\n\n5.3.3 Method 2\nIn the presence of weak gradients, method 2 suggests not calculating extra differences but using a single scoring function. This is done by making song B the baseline.\n\n5.3.3.1 Implementation\n\n\ndef full_song_ig_method_2(\n        model,\n        query_slices,\n        vec_A,\n        baseline_slices,\n        score_fn,\n        steps=120,\n        sigma=0\n):\n    n_slices, H, W, _ = query_slices.shape\n    full_contrast = np.zeros((H, n_slices * W), dtype=np.float32)\n\n    # Normalize target vectors once\n    vecA_tf = tf.nn.l2_normalize(tf.convert_to_tensor(vec_A, dtype=tf.float32), axis=0)\n\n    for i in range(n_slices):\n        q_slice = query_slices[i:i + 1]\n        b_slice = baseline_slices[i:i + 1]\n\n        ig_slice_m2 = ig_one_slice_smooth(\n            model=model,\n            query_slice=q_slice,\n            target_vec=vecA_tf,\n            baseline_slice=b_slice,\n            score_fn=score_fn,\n            steps=steps,\n            sigma=sigma\n        )\n\n        full_contrast[:, i * W:(i + 1) * W] = ig_slice_m2.squeeze()\n\n    return full_contrast\n\n\n\n5.3.3.2 Without Filtering\n\n\nCode\nfull_ig_method_2 = full_song_ig_method_2(\n    model,\n    query_slices=query_slices,\n    vec_A=vec_A,\n    baseline_slices=b_slices,\n    score_fn=cosine_score_fn,\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrgba_img, smoothed_mask = highlight_ig_regions(full_ig_method_2, percentile=95, sigma=2.5)\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))\n\nplt.imshow(rgba_img, origin=\"lower\", aspect=\"auto\")\nplt.title(\"Aggregated IG – why model prefers Song A over Song B\")\nplt.colorbar(label=\"A &gt; B (red)   |   B &gt; A (blue)\")\nplt.tight_layout();\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_ig_to_bins(full_ig_method_2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.4 With Filtering\n\nfull_ig_method_2_smoothed = full_song_ig_method_2(\n    model,\n    query_slices=query_slices,\n    vec_A=vec_A,\n    baseline_slices=b_slices,\n    score_fn=cosine_score_fn,\n    sigma=2.0\n)\nplot_ig_to_bins(full_ig_method_2_smoothed)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, Song A is favored in the lower frequencies, while Song B shows more influence in the upper bands.\n\n\n\n5.4 Conclusion Method 1 vs. Method 2\nOne possible reason why Method 1 (subtracting filtered IGs) gives misleading results: If we apply Gaussian filtering before computing the difference, we might distort subtle but meaningful gradients. Since the raw attributions are weak overall, smoothing may disproportionately amplify or suppress regions — leading to an inaccurate contrast map. In fact, the raw IG maps for A and B look much more similar, and only diverge sharply after filtering.\nThis suggests that Method 2, which uses a single contrastive score function (sim(x, A) - sim(x, B)), is more stable and reliable in cases where the attribution signal is weak and gradients are low.\n\n\n5.5 Interpretation\nAssuming Method 2 provides the correct contrastive explanation, we can proceed with an interpretation. Overall, a Song A is a much better match in the low and mid-frequencies. These findings suggest that the song A’s similarity to the query (in this case, Purple Rain) is driven by features like kick drums, basslines, or low-mid instrumentation — all of which live in those bands.\nBetween 5 kHz and 9 kHz, we see increasing attribution for Song B. These frequencies often correspond to vocals, snares, cymbals, or presence-related features.\nInterestingly, I listened to the tracks on a phone-conference headset, which emphasizes exactly that frequency range. So this auditory similarity aligns with what we hear — and validates the contrastive IG result."

While commercial systems use more advanced models and larger infrastructure, the core principles are the same as the methods demonstrated here. In addition, platforms incorporate collaborative filtering, user history, and social data to drive final recommendations.\nWhat started as an experiment with a small CNN and a few audio clips turned into a concrete example of how machines “hear” music. Deep learning allows us to go beyond surface-level metadata like genre or artist, learning fine-grained acoustic patterns directly from the audio.\nBy exploring techniques like Grad-CAM, Integrated Gradients, and embedding visualization, we’ve opened a window into how machine learning models make decisions about music — and how we can interpret those decisions.\nThis type of analysis helps explain:\n\nWhy a recommendation “feels right”; even if you can’t explain it yourself\nWhy playlist transitions often make musical sense, even when songs come from different genres\n\nIf a basic model trained on a few spectrogram slices can already show interpretable behavior, imagine the scale and nuance of systems like Spotify, Apple Music, or TikTok.\nThis project isn’t just about “how one match happened.” It’s a glimpse into how modern recommendation systems think. Understanding these systems is important for a thoughtful usage."

Any modification affects every instance referencing the same object.\nIn our example, both model1.stress_strain.eps_total and model2.stress_strain.eps_total point to the same NumPy array.\n\n2.1 Fixing the Mutable Default Issue\nThe solution is to ensure that each instance gets its own copy of the mutable object. In @dataclass, this can be achieved using field(default_factory=...) for mutable defaults.\nHere’s the corrected version:\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\n\n@dataclass\nclass CStressStrainData:\n    stress: np.ndarray = field(default_factory=lambda: np.zeros(4))\n    eps_total: np.ndarray = field(default_factory=lambda: np.zeros(4))\n    energy: float = 0\n\n\n2.2 Why Does This Work?\n\nThe expression field(default_factory=...) ensures that a new object is created for each instance during initialization.\nThe lambda function (lambda: np.zeros(4)) ensures that the factory function is called each time, creating an independent NumPy array.\n\nNow, the behavior is as expected:\nmodel1 = MaterialModel()\nmodel2 = MaterialModel()\n\nmodel1.stress_strain.eps_total += np.array([1, 0, 0, 0])\nprint(model2.stress_strain.eps_total)  # Output: [0. 0. 0. 0.]\nEach instance of CStressStrainData now has its own independent eps_total."

These frameworks typically interpret the graph at runtime, similar to how Python interprets code line by line.\nAn ML compiler takes this model graph and optimizes it for performance and/or portability. nstead of executing the model exactly as defined, the compiler transforms the graph into a more efficient form or into a representation that can run on a wider range of devices (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, edge hardware, etc.).\nFor example, XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) — TensorFlow’s compiler — takes the layers of a graph and converts them into HLOs (High-Level Operations). These HLOs form an intermediate representation (IR) that XLA can analyze and optimize before generating code for the target device.\nThe “high” in High-Level Operation refers either to the level of abstraction or to the fact that it sits at the top of XLA’s compilation pipeline."

Instead, they transform the model into another intermediate representation. In many cases, the “compiled” model is not ready to execute on its own. It requires further processing before running.\nThis can make the term “compiler” a bit misleading. It’s less like GCC and more like a pipeline of transformations where performance tuning, graph simplification, and device-specific optimizations happen in stages."

You understand the language you colucator is using, but not the sense of the words. Be it because he is talking gibberish or because the topic is intellectually over you head.\nMost interestingly the pro-verb different cultures use to describe the feeling in these situations vary quite dramatically.\nI stumbled on this in a magazine article by Martina Koch, originally written in German.

    "text": "How we got here\nSo you want to do storytelling? Telling tall tales? But how to start? You are probably much in the same situation as I was in late 2019:\nI had a story to tell, of this I was sure but I did not know how to tell it. Nor did I know where to start to learn how to tell it.\nOriginally, I decided to start a blog to gather resources about storytelling. Very soon I got overwhelmed by the sheer material out there. Just checking the calendar: it is already July 2021. Certainly, it took some time to get here. I used this time to dig into the topic and to clarify my blog’s purpose:\nMy main idea for the blog was storytelling. I want to write about the topic of effective communication and getting the point across. How to not get lost in the myriad of options that we have today.\nI know not every much more precise, but I hope it will help me.\nSo let’s descend down into the mine of storytelling.\n\n\nWhat is storytelling?\nThe most obvious way to obtain this answer could be to look up Wikipedia.\n“Storytelling describes the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, sometimes with improvisation, theatrics, or embellishment.”\nA glance over this article reveals: storytelling is quite a vast field.\nThe two most prominent and established thematic fields are storytelling in fiction and storytelling in marketing.\nStorytelling in fiction is the very process of writing a story.\nStorytelling in marketing is the process to wrap the product in a story to provide a better possibility for the customer to identify with his potential next buy.\n\n\nBusiness storytelling\nI will try to write about a far less popular part of storytelling:\nStorytelling in business decisions.\n“Business decisions” generally means a very large field.\nAspects of business storytelling:\n\nHow to pitch your business idea?\nHow to build a team?\nHow to sell your products?\n\n\n\nBusiness storytelling as an engineer\nDue to my background as a scientist and engineer, I will restrict myself to the question:\nHow to influence business decisions as an engineer?\n\nExamples:\n\nYou have an idea, which you think to be great. How do you convince other people that it is a great idea?\nYou want to change the course of things in you department. What do you need to do?\nYou did something brilliantly in a small team. How do you scale your idea to a larger team, in short how to make your ideas grow?\n\n\n\n\nImpact without power\nThese situations are certainly applicable to many professions. A recurring theme is acting impactful without formal power. There is a high probability that this getting more important as the knowledge economy spreads and we all want to sell on the “marketplace of ideas”.\nThe rise of influencers on platforms such as Youtube and Instagram is one such aspect.\nAt the same time, many big companies aim to democratize decision-making and reduce silo structures by fostering internal communication platforms. In a knowledge network power arises from being a node with many connections. The connections can be two ways, like in a classic network or oneway as for the modern followers.\n\n\nWhat to expect\nThe aim is to have an overview of some good resources on storytelling. In addition, I want to explain key elements like the influence of the audience, story structure, and of course story delivery.\nStay tuned for the next article!"

Such a situation is only possible with positional leadership.\nMaxwell already structured the book into 21 easily digestible chapters.

    "text": "When and how the triangle of trust breaks\n\nBreak down of Communication\nRemote work productivity often falters when the Triangle of Trust—Communication, Engagement, and Conflict Resolution—is not balanced. Here are three situations, I experienced myself, and how to ameliorate them.\n\n“Nobody is listening”:\nWhen emails, chats, and tickets pile up with no response, Communication is broken, and Trust erodes due to limited Transparency. Feedback is shared less frequently. This leads to frustration and a lack of Engagement.\nTo address this, clarity and routine updates must restore Trust by showing that voices are heard and valued, be transparent and be inclusive.\n“Nobody can remember”:\nDeadlines are not met, Engagement is superficial, and Trust suffers as promises go unmet. A lack of concrete action undermines confidence in collaboration. Strengthening Communication through actionable, clear messages is essential to rebuild alignment. Be transparent and show understanding\n“Everybody is talking past each other”:\nThis escalation reflects a breakdown of Conflict Resolution. Frustrating meetings without resolution erode Trust and Engagement, leaving teams demoralized. Clear expectations and effective facilitation can prevent this collapse of the triangle. Be transparent and inclusive and show understanding when not all issues can be accounted for.\n\n\n\nReigniting Engagement\nEngagement wanes when Trust, Communication, and Conflict Resolution are not upheld.\n\nThe silence after a question:\nA lack of Engagement often signals diminished Trust. If team members feel their input won’t be valued or acted upon, they become less reliable. Structuring tasks as opportunities for learning can rebuild their Trust and renew their sense of purpose/involvement.\n‘Yes-people’ trap:\nWith low engagement comes low participation in Conflict Resolution. The team operates without meaningful feedback, weakening Communication . Encouraging challenges and creative problem-solving restores balance by addressing underlying apathy. Provide feedback and opportunities for particapation.\n\n\n\nTrust as common currency\nTrust is build up when all sides of the triangle—Communication, Engagement, and Conflict Resolution—work in harmony. When just one point is not optimal, the others suffer.\n\nLack of transparency:\nWithout detailed and thoughtful communication, Trust and Engagement falter. Teams doubt intentions, leading to disengagement and potential conflicts. Transparency ensures Trust is build up.\nOver-reliance on authority:\nA top-down approach damages Engagement and undermines Conflict Resolution, as it stifles collective input. Highlighting external examples fosters mutual respect and strengthens Communication.\n\n\n\nConflict resolution must be done without personal conflicts\nAs said previously, conflict resolution is necessary. But Conflict becomes detrimental when it overwhelms the Triangle of Trust.\n\nUnproductive meetings:\nHeated discussions indicate a failure of Conflict Resolution, which spills over into poor Communication and disengagement. Using success stories as springboards can redirect the conversation, reminding teams of their capabilities and strengthening Engagement.\nExcessive tension:\nWhen conflict dominates, Trust erodes as teams feel unsafe or undervalued. Balancing conflict by fostering constructive dialogue reinforces all sides of the triangle and encourages innovative problem-solving."

These concepts form the basis for strategic decision-making and influence how we approach the unknown.\n\n2.1 Risk vs. Uncertainty\n\nRisk: Involves measurable probabilities of outcomes, such as rolling dice or forecasting based on historical data.\nUncertainty: Represents scenarios where outcomes and probabilities are entirely unknown, like groundbreaking innovations or market disruptions.\n\nFor more information see this link and this link\n\n\n2.2 Key Distinctions\n\nPredictability: Risk is predictable; uncertainty is not.\nControl: Risks can be managed; uncertainty cannot.\nMeasurability: Risks are quantifiable; uncertainty resists precise measurement.\n\n\n\n2.3 Why Both Matter\nWhile risks allow for control and mitigation, real opportunities for profit and innovation arise in the face of uncertainty. Embracing uncertainty, rather than fearing it, is vital for achieving transformative outcomes.\nIn fact, this is what defines the full risk opportunity matrix. Do not always talk about the risks. Talk about the opportunities, too.\n\n\n\nThe full risk matrix, also features opportunities, https://rolandwanner.com/do-you-really-know-the-risk-matrix/"

It must be understandable, memorable, and, most importantly, capable of inspiring action.\nThe hard truth? Most ideas don’t hit the mark. Even if they’re truthful, relevant, or even fascinating, they can still cannot connect. Why? Because they lack one critical ingredient: emotional resonance."

Facts and logic may inform, but they rarely inspire action.\nTo truly engage people, you need to tap into their emotions and make your message personal.\nConsider how successful charities operate. They don’t just ask for donations to help millions of unnamed people; they focus on one face, one story—a child, an animal, a life you can change. This strategy transforms a broad, abstract cause into a relatable connection."

That’s where the SUCCESS framework, from the book Made to Stick, comes into play:\n\nSimple: Strip your message down to its core. Complexity confuses; simplicity sticks.\nUnexpected: Surprise your audience. Breaking expectations grabs attention.\nConcrete: Use vivid examples and details to make your ideas real and relatable.\nCredible: Back up your claims with proof—whether it’s data, expert endorsements, or relatable stories.\nEmotional: Make people feel something. Tap into their values, fears, and desires.\nStories: Wrap your idea in a compelling narrative. Stories stick better than standalone facts.\n\nWhen you combine these principles, you don’t just share an idea — you create an experience that lingers in the mind and moves the heart."

But what if there was a way to guide your words, like a seasoned explorer, leading them to the very heart of your listeners’ understanding? What if it was a matter of simple technique—one you can learn?\nIn a landscape where information is often forgotten as quickly as it’s learned, there’s a powerful connector that bridges the gap between the known and the unknown. It doesn’t just make ideas clear; it reshapes how we think about them.\nI am talking about generative metaphors.\nBy linking new ideas to familiar concepts, generative metaphors unlock the doors of memory, making your message not only accessible but also unforgettable. They’re an exercise in forced prioritization: if you had to distill your message into one sentence, what would it be?

    "text": "Discovering the Spark, the Art of Story Spotting\nWorkplace stories can be found everywhere, and spotting these stories can be a transformative experience. It’s all about actively observing your surroundings, taking note of emotions, and discovering patterns in everyday life. Connecting personal experiences to broader concepts allows us to create compelling content that resonates with others. Let me share with you a story I told at our last Christmas party that illustrates this point.\n\nThe spark was lid. Photo by Unsplash\n\n\nOur Journey: The Challenges of Remote Work\nAs we gathered around, enjoying the festive atmosphere, I began to recount our team’s journey at FuturTech Solutions.\nWhen our software development team at FuturTech Solutions first transitioned to remote work, we were initially organized in two locations - Austin, Texas, and Seattle, Washington. But as we continued to expand our team, we started hiring talented developers from various parts of the country. As the team leader, I had the responsibility to ensure that our growing team could communicate and collaborate effectively, despite being scattered across different time zones.\nInitially, our team consisted of myself, Tom, and Maria. As we hired new remote members, such as Ravi from San Francisco and Lisa from Miami, we started experiencing challenges in maintaining clear and effective communication. We attempted to organize video conferences at a fixed time, which proved to be inconvenient for some members, especially those in different time zones. As a result, crucial updates and information were not consistently shared with everyone, causing confusion and misunderstandings.\n\n\nFinding the Right Solution\nTo remedy this, I proposed a rotating meeting schedule to accommodate everyone’s availability. However, this plan led to inconsistencies in communication and left some team members, like Lisa, feeling out of the loop. The team also experienced difficulties in tracking project progress and collaborating on tasks, which led to missed deadlines and increased frustration among team members like Ravi.\nIt was clear that a solution was needed urgently, and I felt the weight of responsibility to turn things around for our team. After seeking feedback from my team and researching best practices for remote communication, I decided to introduce Microsoft Teams as our primary collaboration tool. This platform allowed us to have a centralized space for sharing updates, asking questions, and discussing project-related issues without the need for real-time communication.\n\n\nThe Transformation: Unlocking the Potential of Our Team\nThe transformation was dramatic. With the new asynchronous communication model and the powerful features of Microsoft Teams, our team’s collaboration reached new heights. Not only were we able to keep track of project progress more effectively, but we also found ourselves having more meaningful and focused discussions. The weekly sync-up meetings became a valuable opportunity for everyone to connect, share their insights, and learn from each other’s experiences.\nIn the end, our team at FuturTech Solutions emerged stronger and more cohesive than ever. The experience taught us the importance of adapting to change and finding the right tools to support our work. The once-chaotic world of remote communication had been conquered, and our team was poised to tackle even greater challenges together.\n\n\nThe Power of Shared Memories\nAs I concluded the story, I saw the pride and camaraderie in my colleagues’ faces, reminded of their small yet vital roles in our collective success.\nThe Christmas party served as a testament to our resilience and adaptability, becoming a cherished memory that brought us even closer together throughout the following year.\n\n\nStory Spotting Tips\nNow how do you best spot stories?\nFocus on,\n\nActively observing your surroundings and seeking relatable themes,\nEmbracing the ordinary to find inspiration in mundane moments, and\nPracticing mindfulness, active listening, and fostering a creative environment.\n\nBy staying curious and attentive, we can transform everyday experiences into engaging, relatable, and inspiring content.\nHappy story spotting!"

Not only does this foster clarity, but it ensures that every abstraction has roots in something real.\nConcreteness forges connections and ensures memory retention.

As a result, team identity usually starts a life of its own.\nTeams do not act in a vacuum. They usually need to interact with our teams.\nThey quickly become competitive and less productive in achieving an overarching goal.\nComplaints about other teams are the result:\n\n“Team tiger is just not working with us!”\n— Team Winnie"

    "text": "2 The environment fosters team competition.\nIdentification with a team name goes along with the increased commitment to the team. However, groups with a character can automatically lead to low-level competition amongst teams.\nWhat makes the difference is the environment. If the environment enforces competitive behavior, team identity acts as a multiplier. The competitive character provides a selection criterion for the top-down entity and enables competition.\nToday, the two most competitive environments are school and work.\nIn school, cross-class competition is done in science contests, treasure hunts, or sports events. At work, measuring team performance metrics is a source of constant unrest.\nChildren are usually more open than adults. The disgust of the other school will be phrased quite clearly: “You know class 7b are crazy”.\nThese conflicts are usually only visible at work in a lack of cooperation, blaming, and disapproving remarks: “You know, team lions are always sabotaging our efforts by caring about their own goals.”"

But what to do if the case has already deteriorated?\nEnter group therapy! Group therapy bears many names. Bring groups together in a pleasant atmosphere and allow people to familiarize themselves with each other.\nYou will hope for a miracle to occur. Alas, the problem continues. No external force will move team members’ disposition in such a setting.\nThe second frequent mistake: “Please work together and figure it out.” At best, there will be some superficial results, and everybody will be happy that they can work alone afterward.\nThe problem to overcome must threaten the entire organization. Cross-team collaboration is the only solution that has a chance to work. The cooperation allows experiencing a rival as a reasonable fellow and friend. It is difficult to uphold hostility if a triumph is shared.\nIn contrast, in group therapy, no real triumph is shared. The victory will be experienced as a false triumph. While therapy might improve the attitudes toward each other, it will not allow lasting success."

Because we perform activities together in a pleasant environment.\nIn his book “Influence” R. Cialdini describes how compliance techniques move people. Commitment is such a compliance technique. Commitments that are active, public, and effortful are the most successful.\nA party is just that, active and public. However, it is not necessarily effortful (apart from the next day’s hangover).\n\n1.1 Why group workshops can be destructive\nNow let’s look at your last group workshop. Hopefully, it took place in a pleasant atmosphere. Sometimes the venue alone makes up for memory.\nThe three factors in detail:\n\nActivity: everybody was active. The organizer imposes the activeness, but this does not matter.\nPublicity: Most people were talking in public. Many techniques like feedback boards and break-out sessions are public commitment tools.\nEffort: last but not least, planning is hard work and effort.\n\nBut did you feel fulfilled and energized? I remember many planning sessions that left me bewildered, exhausted or both.\nThe principle of commitment can work against you. A hostile atmosphere from the onset and pressure leads to estranging of the team. Even though you might have initial success, later planning rounds might carry the burden of team internal conflicts. People will be there because they have to be. There will be endless discussions as no one wants to drop his stakes and align with a common cause.\nSo what’s missing?"

If these small goals are achieved, everybody will feel good at later planning meetings. The familiarity principle comes to play, and a “We always made a good plan work so far” can become the foundation for more challenging goals.\n\n\n2.2 The coalition of the willing\nLet’s face it. The workplace can sometimes be chaotic. Many people do what they want. Others do not have a clue what is going on. Finally, some give a *****.\nWork-life features its social network. We all orientate ourselves towards each other. We all want to know what Harry is doing, how he is doing it, and who he knows. Team dynamics are governed mainly by the principle of social proof. It relies on\n\ngroup size\nfamiliarity\nand confusion\n\nNew projects launch with small teams, and everybody knows everybody. Team events occur naturally, which further bolsters the team spirit.\nNow you know what you will do in your next greenfield project.\nBut what when your project is already in the taskforce hell? Many projects get on the slippery slope as they struggle to address uncertainty and limit task complexity correctly.\nFocus on the willing people. Try to find similarities between people - their everyday problems. Assemble a coalition of the willing.\n\nDeal with any conflicting points.\nFrom this comes a group strength.\nAnd from strength comes momentum.\nAnd from momentum come the stories that push you forward.\nStories and momentum attract more followers.\n\nConfusion is a critical fact that keeps people from being engaged. Try to show an exact attitude and propose a direction."

Diversity opposes familiarity, and if you let your group run wild, they will certainly discover their differences and hate each other.\nEnter the “party factor.” Allow the group to get familiar with a calm atmosphere. The book “Peopleware” features a chapter called “A spaghetti dinner.” The team’s first task was to have a nice dinner.\nSimilarly, the luncheon technique connects the memory of a shared meal to a person’s face. We shared a good meal that filled our stomachs and made us feel good. We then identify the other person with this meal.\nSometimes organizing a dinner party is not possible. The key is not the dinner party but the shared experience. This piece of memory will serve as the seed of the group identification. The best experiences are experiences of shared victories. Group workshops try to employ this by letting a team build something or overcome an obstacle.\nWith your coalition of the willing, try to find the smallest possible thing that you can fix quickly."
